In SLASH'EM Extended, rings can be identified by dropping them down a sink, just like in vanilla NetHack, but the chance that the ring is regurgitated and not lost was increased to 50%. Additionally, version 2.1.7 introduced the ability to identify amulets by dropping them down a toilet, which can sometimes cause the amulet to be cursed (no message is given if that happens) or rusted (with "The <amulet> rusts!" message). Amulets are preserved with a 75% chance, but the remaining 25% the amulet is not only lost, the player also gets surrounded with hostile out of depth monsters. If you can't handle those monsters, consider using phase door via technique or scroll, or another form of teleportation; a sufficiently high-level character with teleportitis can press Ctrl-T to teleport at will. Testing amulets on a no-teleport level may be a [[Bad Idea]].

== Identifying rings with a sink ==
All [[ring]]s may be identified by dropping them into sinks.
The sink will show an effect depending on the type of ring.
Rings of searching and slow digestion will never be lost; all other rings will be lost down the drain with 50% probability.

After receiving the message you will be given the opportunity to name the kind of ring you dropped, but only if you have not already named it.
A ring of hunger will also not give you the opportunity, if it fails to destroy an item.
Of course, if you have a duplicate of the ring you dropped, you can always name that instead.

Note that most messages require that you are not blind, and the ring of hunger requires that there is a (preferably worthless) object already on the sink.
If these are not the case, you will just get "You hear the ring bouncing down the drain pipe."

== Identifying amulets with a toilet ==
All [[amulet]]s may be identified by dropping them into toilets.
The toilet will show an effect depending on the type of amulet.
After receiving the message you will be given the opportunity to name the kind of amulet you dropped, but only if you have not already named it.
Of course, if you have a duplicate of the amulet you dropped, you can always name that instead.

There is a 75% chance that the amulet will be preserved. If that happens, there is a 33% chance that it becomes cursed with no message, so a previously pet-tested amulet may become unsafe after testing it this way, and a separate 33% chance that the amulet rusts if it was made of a rustprone material. A thoroughly rusty amulet will always rust away when dropped down a toilet. If the amulet was not preserved, "Something comes out of the toilet!" and d6 hostile out of depth monsters are summoned.
