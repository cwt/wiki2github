The Slash'EM Extended variant makes some changes to existing traps and adds several trap types that are not present in other variants. Webs display as ^ to avoid confusion with amulets, and they're more likely to spawn with a spider which is no longer guaranteed to be a giant spider; it can even be a scorpion or other s-class monster that doesn't spin webs. Many traps that do damage will do more damage to the player if they're generated deep in the dungeon, which means arrow traps and suchlike are no longer meaningless to high-level, high-HP characters. Also, some traps can randomly disappear if players or monsters trigger them repeatedly.

Statue traps can have special properties in Slash'EM Extended. They have a 20% chance of being invisible, hiding them from players who lack the see invisible intrinsic; an 8% chance of being hidden underneath a zorkmid, a 7.2% chance of being hidden underneath a boulder, a 6.48% chance of being hidden underneath any random item, a 4.86% chance of being hidden underneath a (cloaked) mimic, a 7.64% chance of being hidden underneath a fungus (biased towards sessile ones), a 4.58% chance of being hidden underneath a jelly (biased towards sessile ones), and a 2.75% chance of being hidden underneath any random monster (which is likely to walk off the trap though). All of these additions are meant to make it more likely for a player to not see the statue in advance and be surprised by the trap.

Spoiler alert: There are lots of traps that have been added in Slash'EM Extended. Some of them are very hard to figure out, so this section is a massive spoiler.
A %s trap. These are fairly benign.

In fact, the yellow spell trap is an excellent way to confuse the player (not the player's character). :-)

Standard traps

^ ice trap (from Unnethack) - does cold damage (less if cold resistant) to a player walking into it, sometimes freezing them and/or shattering potions in their inventory.

^ spear trap (from Sporkhack) - does a high amount of damage to the player. A player polymorphed into a thick-skinned monster removes the trap without taking damage, and a levitating character or one polymorphed into an unsolid monster doesn't take damage either.

^ ceiling collapse trap (from Sporkhack) - only triggers once, and drops a shower of rocks and boulders on the player. The damage done by this trap can be very high; a worn hard helmet mitigates the effects a bit, but it can still be instant death if the player's maximum hit points aren't high.

^ magic beam trap (from Sporkhack) - fires a random beam at the player or monster triggering it. The type and direction of the beam is always the same for a given trap, and it is removed after being triggered often enough.

^ heap of shit - hazardous for players by doing acid damage (less if acid resistant), possibly damaging the player's worn boots (lower chance if they're erodeproof or of a type that can't be eroded, but it can still happen). Can remove the player's intrinsic or temporary speed or cause paralysis (free action usually prevents the latter). However, monsters triggering this trap experience no harmful effects; instead, they speed up if they weren't fast already, so it might actually be a good idea to displace a pet onto a heap of shit. Flying or levitating players won't trigger this trap. If it is triggered often enough, it disappears.

^ animation trap - can be triggered by the player only and also triggers only once, summoning one or more random monsters for the player to fight. If the player triggers it, the message "es come to life!" is displayed, and monsters are generated, similarly to a magic trap's effects, but without the blindness. This trap has a 10% chance of appearing in a statue room instead of a statue trap.

^ glyph of warding - deals a moderate amount of damage. The damage is randomly selected to be physical, fire, cold, or shock damage; if the player is resistant to the selected element, the trap will do no damage at all. However, the player will also suffer from an additional bad effect every time a glyph of warding is triggered. There is a 10% chance of it disappearing if the player triggers it, and it's also possible to untrap a glyph of warding (20% base success rate), which may reward the player with 4 experience points.

^ blade trap - also known as "scything blade", does some damage to whoever triggers it, and more if the target has a head. Unsolid beings are immune to this trap. It can also be untrapped with a 25% chance, which rewards the player with 3 points of experience.

^ bolt trap - acts like an arrow trap except it fires crossbow bolts that do more damage compared to arrows. Untrapping a bolt trap turns it into a stack of crossbow bolts that can be picked up, and it can also run out of projectiles if triggered repeatedly.

^ acidpool - a ground-based trap that does acid damage (less if acid resistant) to the player. It can also corrode some of the player's worn armor, and monsters can trigger it as well. Flying or levitating monsters and players don't trigger this trap, and it can be untrapped for a chance of acquiring potions of acid.

^ waterpool - a ground-based trap that does damage unless the player is levitating, flying, swimming, waterwalking or unbreathing. Levitation, waterwalking and flying protect the player's inventory, otherwise there is a 5% chance that items become wet, including lethe damage if the current dungeon level has lethe water. Monsters walking into this trap take a low amount of damage and have a chance of removing the trap, and the player can also untrap it for a chance of acquiring potions of water.

^ poison gas trap - poisons the player to do damage and sometimes randomly reduce an attribute. For non-poison resistant players, the poison can also be deadly, resulting in instadeath. Unbreathing makes the player completely immune to this trap. Monsters triggering it will take a small amount of damage unless poison resistant or unbreathing, sometimes removing the trap in the process.

^ slow gas trap - slows down non-unbreathing players and monsters walking into it.

^ shock trap - does lightning damage (less if shock resistant) to a player walking into it. There's a good chance of the player being numbed for a time, and wands and rings in the player's inventory may explode.

^ swarm trap - summons a bunch of themed monsters on the current dungeon level. This trap only triggers once and only gives a message 10% of the time.

^ heel trap - basically a copy of the effect caused by monsters using footwear as weapons. It can be untrapped to retrieve a copy of the weapon/boot/whatever that was used in the trap, but unlike most other traps, it cannot be removed by digging down.

^ vulnerability trap - will temporarily disable a random in/extrinsic of the player. It can also choose to disable something the player doesn't have (yet); e.g. if it disables fire resistance on a non-resistant player, it means the player won't be fire resistant even if he later eats a red dragon corpse or puts on a ring of fire resistance as long as the effect is still active. However, internally, the player does still gain the resistance from eating corpses or putting on items, and they start working as soon as the vulnerability times out. If the trap decides to disable an attribute that's already disabled, the timer until that intrinsic will work again is increased.

^ lava trap - transforms into lava upon being triggered and also turns random nearby squares into lava. The player doesn't instantly fall in, though, so if there is still some adjacent land, the player can easily save themselves. Flying and levitation also prevent the player from dying to this trap.

^ flood trap - transforms into water upon being triggered and also turns random nearby squares into water. A player who can't fly or levitate will fall into the water, blanking their stuff and possibly even drowning them if no adjacent land tiles exist.

^ drain trap - will drain an experience level of the character; being resistant to level drain will protect the player.

^ disintegration trap - will disintegrate the player's armor, shield, or cloak, or if the player is wearing none, the player is disintegrated instead. Being disintegration resistant will offer full protection, though.

^ item teleporter - like a teleport trap, but instead of the player, it teleports the player's items. Every time the player triggers it, there's a certain chance of each of their items teleporting to a random empty location, which is to say they won't be in the player's inventory anymore.

^ death trap - does exactly what it says on the tin. Actually, most of the time, the player will just take damage to their HP and max HP, but occasionally it can instakill. Magic resistance reduces the damage taken and removes the instakill possibility.

^ pestilence trap - makes the player deathly sick, unless they are sickness resistant.

^ famine trap - makes the player more hungry if triggered. It is very possible to be bumped from "Not Hungry" to "Weak" or even "Fainting" instantly!

^ stone to flesh trap - casts the stone to flesh spell on the player, possibly transforming valuable lithic items into useless food. Rings are especially endangered, since most of them are made of mineral.

^ quicksand - causes random amounts of damage to the unlucky player who steps into it. Flying or levitating characters have a chance of being unaffected, but sometimes they will trigger this trap anyway, and the damage done can sometimes be highly excessive.

^ relocation trap - will teleport monsters and players that trigger it to a random empty location on the level, even if the level in question is no-teleport. This trap is removed if the player triggers it, but not if it's triggered by a monster.

^ gravity trap - makes the player's inventory much heavier for a period of time. The actual weight added to the player's encumbrance is equal to the number of turns for which the effect will last, which means that it will gradually time out, but if the initial value is high, the player may be temporarily pushed into stressed encumbrance or even worse.

^ recursion trap - permanently changes the player's role and/or race. This trap is removed once triggered, so there is no way to trigger it repeatedly until the player becomes their favorite role/race combo. Also, if the player ascends after triggering it, the resulting high score entry will say that they ascended as whatever new role or race they were, even though the Ctrl-X screen also remembers the starting role/race.

^ temporary recursion trap - temporarily changes the player's role and/or race, and only triggers once. Like with the recursion trap, ascending while being a role or race that's different from the starting one will count as ascending whatever character the player was at the point of ascension, but this particular trap causes the player to turn back into the previous role/race after a random amount of turns.

^ warp zone - banishes the player to any random level in the Dungeons of Doom or Gehennom. Players with the Amulet of Yendor are immune, mainly to make sure they cannot use it to bypass levels on the Ascension Run.

^ mind wipe trap - causes amnesia.

^ throwing star trap - shoots a shuriken at whoever triggered it. Can be untrapped to receive a stack of shuriken, or triggered repeatedly until it runs out. The shuriken can also be poisoned, so non-resistant players beware.

^ shit pit - like a pit, but it also does acid damage and tries to damage the player's worn shoes, or does extra damage if the player is bare-footed. This also happens every time the player tries to move out of it!

^ shaft - a trap door that is more likely to send the player down multiple dungeon levels.

^ lock trap - simulates effects from trapped chests.

^ MC trap - The player's magic cancellation will temporarily be weaker once this trap is triggered. Triggering it repeatedly will cause the effect to stack, potentially reducing the MC value by even more. There are items that give more than 3 points of MC, though, and wearing such an item can allow the player to still have MC3 despite the trap.

^ gateway from hell - summons a bunch of hostile major demons for the player to fight. Only triggers once.

^ growing trap - creates trees around the player, which may require an axe to get rid of. Only triggers once.

^ cooling trap - creates ice tiles around the player. Only triggers once.

^ bar trap - creates iron bars around the player, which are difficult to get rid of. There are a select few weapons capable of bashing down iron bars, and a confused scroll of barrhing will also help. Only triggers once.

^ locking trap - transforms open floor and room squares into solid rock, and doorways/broken doors into locked doors. If it happens on a level with undiggable walls, the newly created solid rock can still be dug open with a pick-axe or similar means. Only triggers once.

^ air trap - creates clouds around the player. Only triggers once.

^ terrain trap - creates water, lava, ice, clouds, and trees around the player randomly. Only triggers once.

^ loudspeaker - whenever anyone walks on it, the game displays fake messages, and any loudspeaker on the current dungeon level will also blurt out random messages every once in a while to confuse the player with stuff like "You are slowing down." or "Demogorgon stings you!"

^ nest trap - can only be triggered once, and summons a squad of monsters at a specific place on the level.

^ bullet trap - fires bullets at whoever triggered it. Untrapping it can generate a stack of bullets for the player to grab.

^ cyanide trap - Halves the player's current HP, and also deals poison damage.

^ laser trap - Deals a fixed amount of damage to the player.

^ giant chasm - A more dangerous variant of the pit trap that takes ages to get out of.

^ fart trap - causes random bad effects and displays messages that belong into adult visual novel territory. Untrapping it is possible, but very difficult. Digging a pit on the square will not work.

^ confusion trap - The player is confused for a period of time.

^ stun trap - The player is stunned for a period of time.

^ hallucination trap - The player hallucinates for a period of time.

^ petrification trap - The player turns to stone and will need to eat a lizard corpse or otherwise depetrify themselves. With petrification resistance, the player is safe from its effects, however.

^ numbness trap - The player is numbed for a period of time.

^ freezing trap - The player is frozen for a period of time.

^ burning trap - The player is burned for a period of time.

^ fear trap - The player is stricken with fear for a period of time.

^ blindness trap - The player is blinded for a period of time.

^ glib trap - The player has slippery fingers for a period of time.

^ slime trap - The player turns into a green slime. Setting oneself on fire is one of the possible ways to prevent the end result.

^ inertia trap - removes intrinsic speed, and slows the player to half of their usual speed for a while.

^ time trap - drains an experience level (drain resistance doesn't help), or drains a random stat by five points, or drains all of the player's stats by one.

^ lycanthropy trap - like being infected by a werewolf; lycanthropic races are immune. The player will always become a wereWOLF, as opposed to e.g. a wererat.

^ unlight trap - the entire current dungeon level becomes unlit.

^ elemental trap - does fire, cold, and shock damage to the player, each with their own chances of item destruction happening.

^ escalating trap - does more damage the more often it's triggered. The escalation counter is global for all such traps, and is also shared by the "escalating damage" attack possessed by some monsters.

^ negative trap - causes effects similar to applying a cursed unicorn horn.

^ mana trap - damages both the player's HP and Pw.

^ sin trap - replicates the nasty effects from the Seven Deadly Sins' melee attacks, including item teleportation and other bad stuff. On the Vibrating Square level, each of the Seven Deadly Sins is generated with a sin trap underneath.

^ destroy armor trap - can destroy a worn piece of armor, but magic resistance, the item being blessed, the item's positive enchantment, and some other factors give a saving throw.

^ divine anger trap - the player's deity will get angry if this trap is triggered.

^ genetic trap - similar to a polymorph trap, but the player can also polymorph into monsters that are not a valid polymorph form.

^ missingno trap - similar to a polymorph trap, but the player will transform into a monster that the developers never made. Often, these polymorph forms cannot move, cannot attack, have single-digit hit points, or are otherwise crippling and useless.

^ cancellation trap - replicates the effect of being zapped by a wand of cancellation.

^ hostility trap - turns tame and peaceful monsters into hostiles.

^ boss trap - summons a unique monster.

^ earthquake trap - only triggers once, and causes an earthquake like a drum of earthquake, with the magnitude depending on the current monster difficulty. The affected area is randomly littered with pits.

^ glass arrow trap - like an arrow trap, but shoots glass arrows that deal more damage.

^ glass bolt trap - like a bolt trap, but shoots glass bolts that deal more damage.

^ falling boulder trap - drops a boulder on the player's head; wearing a hard helmet decreases the damage somewhat. It can trigger repeatedly until it runs out of ammo, making it a potential source of boulders should the player need any.

^ out of magic trap - sets the player's current Pw to 0 and likely also drains the maximum.

^ plasma trap - stuns the player and deals fire damage, possibly burning scrolls and spellbooks and boiling potions.

^ contact bomb - explodes when triggered, dealing high damage and creating lots of pits around the player.

^ noise trap - deals damage and stuns the player, may break potions.

^ glue trap - keeps the player in place, and requires a lot of turns to break free from; if the player can teleport ouf of the trap, they get released.

^ guillotine trap - A player who has a head will be instakilled 5% of the time when triggering this trap. Otherwise, it deals high physical damage.

^ bisection trap - A player who isn't at least "huge" (by e.g. being polymorphed into a dragon) will be instakilled 5% of the time when triggering this trap. Otherwise, it deals high physical damage.

^ volt trap - deals shock damage to the player and may cause numbness or paralysis; can destroy wands and rings.

^ horde trap - summons a bunch of monsters around the player accompanied by the cryptic message "e Pale Wraith with a lightning stroke.".

^ immobility trap - surrounds the player with random sessile monsters, accompanied by the cryptic message "vailable, exit anyway?".

^ glyph of guarding/protection/animation/summoning/massive damage/number seven - like the glyph of warding but also causes various other bad effects when triggered. Can be untrapped. The color of this glyph is actually different depending on the exact type of trap.

^ falling loadstone trap - A loadstone appears out of nowhere and lands in the player's inventory, cursed.

^ falling nastystone trap - A random nasty gray stone appears out of nowhere and lands in the player's inventory, cursed.

^ summon undead trap - summons undead monsters around the player accompanied by the cryptic message "ge broadcast by Arabella to confuse unwary players.".

^ spined ball trap - deals some damage to the player, can be untrapped to receive a morning star.

^ pendulum trap - deals some damage to the player, can be untrapped to receive an iron chain.

^ turn table - Usually stuns the player and may also push them back; very rarely you "sense words of ouija board..." and receive enlightenment, which deletes the trap.

^ scent trap - infiltrates the player's nose with a random scent, which can have various mostly bad effects.

^ banana trap - Abuses the player's dexterity when triggered.

^ falling tub trap - A bathtub falls from above and may hit the player, dealing some damage, and the player will also be stunned. Occasionally the water splashes all around the character, wetting their entire inventory.

^ alarm - Aggravates (i.e. wakes up) nearby monsters.

^ caltrops trap - Hurts the player's legs, deals a little damage and can also cause a couple turns of inertia. When wearing boots, there's a one in three chance for the player to not be affected.

^ blade wire - Can randomly cause the player to lose some HP or be paralyzed for a few turns.

^ magnet trap - All iron items are removed from the player's inventory and randomly pushed to nearby squares. This includes worn items, which can be a useful way of getting rid of a cursed item, but only if the material of that item is specifically iron; all other items, even those made of other types of metal, are unaffected.

^ slingshot trap - Shoots a rock at the player. Can be untrapped to receive a random stack of rocks.

^ cannon trap - deals high damage to the player.

^ venom sprinkler - randomly hits the player with either a blinding or acid venom.

^ fumarole - every turn the player spends on or adjacent to a fumarole, they will be hit by poison, dealing damage (unless poison resistant) and possibly draining strength. The poison also has the usual small chance of being fatal. Locating this trap via searching may help to avoid it, although doing so requires the player to be affected by it continuously as the search command only finds adjacent traps.

^ mana pit - A pit that reduces the player's mana while they're stuck in it. If the player's current mana reaches zero that way, it may drain the maximum.

^ elemental portal - Summons random E-class monsters around the player.

^ girliness trap - Summons a bunch of farting monsters around the player.

^ fumbling trap - When triggered, the player will fumble for a while.

^ egomonster trap - Surrounds the player with random egotype monsters, accompanied by the cryptic message "hwer!".

^ flooding trap - Creates random water and lava tiles near the player. Every such tile will have a random sea monster.

^ monster cube - Does nothing when triggered by the player; while the player is on the same level as a monster cube, it will spawn a monster every once in a while with a low chance of turning into an animation trap after spawning a monster.

^ cursed grave - Does nothing when triggered by the player; while the player is on the same level as a cursed grave, it will spawn an undead monster every once in a while with a low chance of turning into a summon undead trap after spawning a monster.

^ ventilator - Doesn't do anything special when triggered by the player, but standing on or next to the ventilator will push the player to a nearby square in a random direction.

^ dimness trap - Afflicts the player with the Dim status condition for a period of time.

^ evil artifact trap - Creates a random bad artifact and forces the player character to equip it. This trap only triggers once.

^ rodney trap - If the Wizard of Yendor has not been awakened yet, triggering this trap wakes him up prematurely and sets a timeout for the random harassment that will go on until the player ascends.

^ nexus trap - Will randomly phase door, teleport or levelport the player, or scramble their stats. While it's theoretically possible to do nexus trap dancing hoping for a beneficial stat swap (e.g. if the player has a strength of 8 and a charisma of 21 and is hoping to get the two of them to swap), there's a chance that this trap is deleted upon triggering.

^ leg trap - Holds the player in place, like a bear trap, but also causes the wounded legs status effect for a while.

^ map amnesia trap - Causes the player to forget the map of the current dungeon level when triggered.

^ spreading trap - Doesn't do anything when triggered. However, being on the same level as a spreading trap means there's a random chance per turn that a random trap is created somewhere on the level.

^ adjacent trap - Doesn't do anything when triggered, but standing next to this trap will create a new random trap underneath the player if there isn't one on that tile already.

# superthing from level 55 - Standing on or next to this trap will paralyze the player for up to 5 turns. Farlooking this trap displays "Rien ne va plus!" and paralyzes the player for up to 20 turns.

^ current shaft - a trap door that is more likely to send the player down multiple dungeon levels, and which is triggered even if the player is flying or levitating.

^ levitation trap - Causes the player to levitate for a while when triggered. This levitation is uncontrolled, so the player can't simply press > to end it.

^ bowel cramps trap - Makes the player nauseated when triggered, or if that's already the case, causes up to 5 turns of paralysis.

^ unequipping trap - only triggers once, and unequips all equipped weapons, armor pieces, blindfold-slot tools, rings, amulets and implants, with the message "You are completely startled by a sudden sound." If the player can find this trap without triggering it, it's then possible to save it for later use when you want to get rid of cursed gear.

^ gender trap - only triggers once, with the message "You don't feel like yourself." A male character will become female and in reverse, just like putting on the amulet of change does.

^ trap of opposite alignment - only triggers once, and makes a lawful player chaotic or in reverse; neutral characters become either lawful or chaotic. The player's divine protection is erased in the process, and "Your mind oscillates briefly." is displayed.

^ sincount trap - Displays "You feel sinful...", and increases the amount of sins by one, plus the player loses 5 points of alignment record.

^ beamer - Like a teleport trap, but even a magic resistant player will trigger it and be teleported.

^ level beamer - Like a level teleporter, but even a magic resistant player will trigger it and be levelported.

^ pet trap - If the player triggers it, nothing happens. However, any pet that walks on this trap will die instantly. Can also affect a ridden steed.

^ piercing beam trap - Like a magic beam trap, fires a beam at the player who triggers it, however the player's reflection (if present) is also deactivated so the beam cannot be reflected. There's a 5% chance for this trap to disappear every time it is triggered.

^ wrenching trap - Has a random effect from the following list: teleport the player on the same dungeon level; aggravate monsters; temporary blindness; player loses all gold carried in the open; temporary confusion; be poisoned, lose strength and player's gloves might suffer from corrosion damage; up to 25 points of HP damage; player's inventory items are randomly cursed. These are all duplicates of potential backfires when reading a spellbook.

^ tracker trap - Only triggers once, and teleports the player to the first monster on the current level's internal monster list. If no monster is present, nothing happens, but the trap is still deleted.

^ back to start trap - Only triggers once, and if the player isn't prevented from level teleportation, they are teleported back to dungeon level 1.

^ nemesis trap - Only triggers once, and summons a hostile clone of the player's quest nemesis, with the message "Ha ha ha ha! Wa ha ha ha! You are so doomed!"

^ strew trap - Randomly drops some of the player's items and pushes them to random nearby squares; potions and other items made of fragile material will probably break in the process. Additionally, the player is surrounded by monsters, which might use some of the scattered items against the player. Triggering this trap displays the message "You are greatly startled by a sudden sound."

^ outta depth trap - Only triggers once, and surrounds the player with hostile out of depth monsters. Displays "Several monsters come out of a portal."

^ punishment trap - Only triggers once, and punishes the player with a ball and chain. If the player is already punished, the ball is made heavier.

^ fountain trap - Mimics most of the effects of quaffing from a fountain, however certain effects (e.g. getting a wish) cannot occur. The actual effect is randomized every time the player triggers this trap. There is a 1 in 6 chance per use that this trap disappears.

^ throne trap - Mimics most of the effects of sitting on a throne, however certain effects (e.g. getting a wish) cannot occur. The actual effect is randomized every time the player triggers this trap. There is a 1 in 6 chance per use that this trap disappears.

^ anoxic pit - Like a pit trap, but being stuck inside without magical breathing will deal 3*experience level damage to the player each turn with the message "The air in the anoxic pit does not contain oxygen! You can't breathe!"

# arabella speaker - whenever anyone walks on it, the game displays fake messages, and any loudspeaker on the current dungeon level will also blurt out random messages every once in a while to confuse the player with stuff like "You are slowing down." or "Demogorgon stings you!". Visible by default. Farlooking it displays "NETHACK.EXE caused a General Protection Fault at address 000D:001D." and paralyzes the player for d30 turns.

^ filler trap - Only triggers once. Displays "The floor around you vibrates in a strange way." and rolls a random trap type, then places a bunch of traps of the type it rolled on random squares.

^ toxic venom trap - Badly poisons the player, dealing stat damage and potentially destroying potions or food in open inventory.

^ insanity trap - Only triggers once, and fills the entire level with themed monsters.

^ madness trap - Afflicts the player with many status effects when triggered.

^ kop cube - Does nothing when triggered, and cannot be made visible. While on the same level as a kop cube, there's a 1 in 2000 chance per turn that a random K-class monster spawns on the kop cube as long as there's no monster on it already, and the kops created this way have a higher than usual chance of being out of depth. Whenever a kop cube spawns a kop, there is a 1 in 20 chance for the trap to disappear.

^ boss spawner - Does nothing when triggered, and cannot be made visible. While on the same level as a boss spawner, there's a small chance per turn that a boss monster spawns and the trap disappears.

^ contamination trap - Increases the player's contamination when triggered.

^ evil heel trap - Only triggers once, and forces the player to equip a cursed pair of high heels that is created from thin air.

^ bad equipment trap - Only triggers once, and forces the player to equip a random cursed piece of equipment that is created from thin air.

^ tempoconflict trap - Grants temporary intrinsic conflict when triggered.

^ tempohunger trap - Grants temporary intrinsic hunger when triggered.

^ teleportitis trap - Grants temporary intrinsic teleportitis when triggered.

^ polymorphitis trap - Grants temporary intrinsic polymorphitis when triggered.

^ premature death trap - Grants temporary premature death when triggered. Whether or not the player will die from this effect depends on the mood of the RNG.

^ lasting amnesia trap - Grants temporary map amnesia when triggered.

^ ragnarok trap - Causes a ragnarok event when triggered, which creates lava and lots of outta depth monsters and starts Etherwind.

^ single disenchant trap - Only triggers once, and there is a 1 in 10 chance for each of the player's items to be disenchanted. This effect does not harm items inside of the player's containers.

^ acid pit - Like a regular pit, but each turn the player spends inside will spray them with acid, which deals damage (acid resistance helps) and can corrode items in open inventory.

^ severe disenchant trap - Only triggers once, and there is a 1 in 10 chance for each of the player's items to be disenchanted. This effect does not harm items inside of the player's containers, but can reduce the enchantment of items below +0, unlike regular disenchantment.

^ pain trap - The player takes damage equal to one tenth of their max HP when triggering this trap.

^ trembling trap - Increases the player's "trembling" amount, a hidden stat seen only in enlightenment that reduces to-hit and spellcasting chances. This effect times out very slowly.

^ techcap trap - Increases the timeout of a random technique, so the player has to wait until it can be used again.

^ spell memory trap - Reduces the memory of a random spell in the player's spell repertoire.

^ skill reduction trap - Reduces the amount of training in a random skill. This effect can roll skills the player doesn't know, in which case there's no visible effect (although skill training is still being tracked for restricted skills behind the scenes); if it rolls a known skill and the amount of training in that is below the threshold for the player's current skill level, the player's proficiency in that skill is reduced and the skill point(s) spent to reach that threshold are refunded.

^ skillcap trap - Has a chance of reducing the maximum reachable skill level of a random skill when triggered.

^ permanent stat damage trap - Reduces one of the player's six stats by one, and it cannot be restored via unicorn horn, restore ability or similar methods, but has to be trained back up from scratch.

^ hybrid trap - Randomly adds or removes a hybrid race, which can have significant effects on gameplay depending on which one it rolls.

^ shapechange trap - Only triggers once, displays "Something seems to be changing shape." and summons a bunch of shapeshifting monsters on random tiles of the current dungeon level.

^ miguc trap - Paralyzes the player for a couple of turns and summons a monster, which can then start attacking the helpless player.

^ directive trap - Only triggers once, and permanently changes one of the directives for the player's pets. The directives are "can the pet collect items?", "can the pet attack monsters, and if yes, can it attack peaceful ones too or only hostile ones?", "can the pet eat food off the ground?", "can the pet try to follow the player?", and "what is the percentage chance that enemy attacks are redirected to the player's steed?". If the player lacks the directive technique and also doesn't know the directive spell, this trap can result in being severely screwed over because there's no way to force the directive to be changed again.

^ satatue trap - like a regular statue trap, but the monster depicted by it has a higher chance of being out of depth at the time of generation.

^ farting web - can hold the player in place like a regular web, and as long as the player is still trapped by it, random bad effects happen on every turn.

^ cataclysm trap - only triggers when there isn't a ragnarok timer currently going on, and if it does trigger, the trap is deleted and a ragnarok timer is set. Once that timer runs out, a ragnarok event happens that summons a bunch of high-level monsters, transforms tiles into lava randomly, and starts Etherwind.

^ data delete trap - only triggers once, and deletes the player's data. This is a highly detrimental effect that can completely ruin the player character.

^ elder tentacling trap - only triggers once, and summons a hostile elder priest next to the player. The elder priest is the most dangerous monster in the game and capable of easily wiping out even an otherwise ascension-ready character.

^ footerer trap - only triggers if there's no footerer effect currently active, and if it does trigger, the trap is deleted and the footerer effect set to happen on a random dungeon level. If the player then enters the dungeon level in question, a squad of very out of depth themed monsters is spawned.

^ bubble trap - Only triggers once, and changes random nearby floor tiles to bubbles.

^ rain cloud trap - Only triggers once, and changes random nearby floor tiles to rain clouds.

^ item nastification trap - Puts a nastytrap curse on one of the player's worn armor pieces. This trap only triggers once; if the player isn't wearing any armor, the trap triggers anyway and just disappears without doing anything. It should be noted that this trap can also remove other object properties that were on the affected armor piece, so e.g. an "enchanted (of free action) plate mail" can become "enchanted (of Team Nastytrap) plate mail".

^ sanity increase trap - Increases the player's sanity when triggered.

^ psi trap - Mimics the effect of psi attacks, i.e. the player is usually hit by a status effect and may also occasionally lose intelligence and wisdom, or suffer from amnesia, or be hit by other bad effects.

^ gay trap - Only triggers once, and randomly sets the player's sexual orientation to "undecided", "heterosexual" or "homosexual", which affects the results when consorting with a foocubus.
Useful traps

These traps are useful to the player in some way. Unlike regular traps, they're generally displayed by the $ glyph. While the game still gives a warning message if the player is about to trigger one, it can often be good to set them off on purpose.

$ wishing trap - only triggers once, and grants a wish to the lucky player.

$ artifact jackpot trap - Creates a random artifact when triggered. If the artifact in question is a weapon, armor piece, ring, amulet or implant, its base type will be rerolled to a random other eligible item, which can result in e.g. "morning star named Excalibur" or "plasteel cloak named Deluder". The item in question will retain the specific effects of that artifact. Also, the skill associated with the created artifact will be unlocked if the player didn't have it, with a cap of Basic, or if the player already knew the skill, there is a chance that the cap increases by one. This trap will only trigger once.

$ good artifact trap - Creates a random artifact when triggered. The skill associated with the created artifact will be unlocked if the player didn't have it, with a cap of Basic, or if the player already knew the skill, there is a chance that the cap increases by one. This trap will only trigger once.

$ nurse trap - only triggers once, and increases the player's maximum HP. If the player's max HP is less than 10 times their experience level, the increase is bigger.

$ boon trap - only triggers once, and randomly grants a wish, an acquirement, a random great item or a random artifact to the player.
Nasty traps

Below this point are the "nasty" traps. These are the reason why the spoiler warning exists; figuring out how they work is very difficult without looking at the source code or reading spoilers. First of all, they don't reveal themselves or show a message even if the player triggers them, so a player new to Slash'EM Extended may be clueless as to where the effects are coming from. Secondly, most of these traps' effects are status effects with a long timeout that can be cured only by applying a switcher (rarely generated tool-class item; 1 out of 1000 randomly generated tools will be one, and a cursed one will just dissolve with no effect 50% of the time) or by waiting for the timeout to expire. And last but not least, most of these traps screw with the player's interface in some way or another, making the game much harder to play.

Most of these traps cannot be removed by untrapping them, although it is possible to find them by searching. In fact, these traps may be a reason why automatic searching is less of a liability in Slash'EM Extended version v83 and higher (which is when the nasty traps got added) - statue traps are generated a lot less often due to the existence of new traps, and finding the new nasty traps without triggering them can save the player from lots of trouble. Some of these traps are so nasty that their generation frequency is reduced in comparison to other traps. The Geek role has halved duration for negative status effects caused by these traps, and the Graduate role only suffers from their effects for one quarter of their usual duration. Monsters are immune to all of these traps and can freely walk over them unphased.

^ rmb loss trap - short for "right mouse button loss", even though the right mouse button isn't really used often in this game. Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the rmb loss condition that displays as "Your right mouse button failed" on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, the player can't use the farlook command to find out what a glyph is, and objects, traps and most special dungeon features like stairs and trees become invisible (the see invisible intrinsic doesn't help here), making it much harder to tell what is actually going on.

^ display trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the display loss condition that displays as "Your display failed" on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, the player's status line at the bottom of the screen stops working and may even disappear completely, so the player can't tell which dungeon level he is on or how many hit points/mana they have left, and status conditions like "Slime" or "FoodPois" are no longer displayed either. When restoring the game with a character that suffers from display loss, instead of telling the player which dungeon level they return to, it displays a generic YAFM.

^ spell loss trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the spell loss condition that displays as "You lost spells" on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, opening the spellcasting menu doesn't show the names or any other information of the player's spells, so the player won't know about their fail rates, spell level, spell memory etc. However, parts of this effect may be cheated by taking notes while the character doesn't have this condition yet. Also, the spells will still be castable and have their normal effects.

^ weakness trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the weakness condition that displays as "Being weak from hunger damages your health" on the enlightenment screen, and if the player's hunger condition is weak or worse while under the effect, they will silently lose HP every turn. Sometimes their max HP is damaged too, and eventually the player will die. What's especially nasty about this trap is the fact that there is no message even if the player is using showdmg, meaning that the player might not even notice their health dropping; having statuscolors turned on might help to prevent death though.

^ menu trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the menu bug condition that displays as "You have the menu bug" on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, certain commands like "loot" or "show previous message" stop working and instead show that the selected command is unavailable, so the player can't perform certain types of actions. However, being under this trap's effect also allows the player to come back to life after death, as long as the player wasn't genocided and didn't die by brainlessness. Doing so will drain two experience levels (or fail if the player's level is lower than 3, resulting in DYWYPI) and remove all of the player's items, erase all entries from their spellbook and summon several types of monsters around them. Thus, the player is very likely to die again quickly, which means this trap isn't really usable as a "poor man's amulet of life saving".

^ DSTW trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the DSTW condition that displays as "Your potions don't always work." on the enlightenment screen, and if the player quaffs a potion while under the effect it may randomly do nothing.

^ status trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the status bug condition that displays as "You can't cure status effects." on the enlightenment screen, and status effects like hallucination, confusion etc. cannot be cured any more if the player is hit by them while under the trap's effect. Also, if the player triggers the trap while already having a status effect, that status effect also won't be possible to cure. The only solution is to wait out the duration of status effects instead.

^ auto destruct trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the auto destruct condition that displays as "An auto destruct mechanism was initiated" on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, the player can no longer perform multi-turn actions that can be interrupted, e.g. reading a spellbook or digging with a pick-axe, as they will be interrupted every turn.

^ free hand trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the free hand loss condition that displays as "Your free hand is less likely to be free" on the enlightenment screen, and applying any item will then cause the player to wield it, losing a turn. Only if the item in question is already wielded, the player will actually be able to apply it for an effect.

^ caster trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the casting problem condition that displays as "You have blood mana" on the enlightenment screen, and spells become more difficult to cast the lower the player's current HP is in relation to their max HP. If the player is near death while under this effect, their spells are all at least 90% likely to fail, which can be fatal if the player relies on being able to cast healing spells.

^ sound trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the deafness condition that displays as "You have a hearing break" on the enlightenment screen, and the player won't be able to hear for a while, causing messages like "You hear some noises in the distance" to not appear.

^ memory trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the memory loss condition that displays as "There is low local memory" on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, most messages shown by the status line at the top of the screen no longer display their actual text, saying "Warning: Low Local Memory. Freeing description strings." instead. This makes it very easy to miss important messages, since lines like "Your limbs are stiffening." or "The invisible Demogorgon stings you!" are transformed into the generic low local memory message too.

^ unidentify trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the unidentify condition that displays as "Your possessions sometimes unidentify themselves" on the enlightenment screen, and while under the effect, items in the player's inventory sometimes lose their known BUC status, fire/rustproof status, enchantment value and (for blinded players only) appearance.

^ difficulty trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the difficulty condition that displays as "The difficulty of the game was arbitrarily increased." on the enlightenment screen, and the difficulty for random monster spawns is increased by 10 for the duration of the effect.

^ speed trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the speed bug condition that displays as "You have the speed bug" on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, the player's movement speed will randomly be increased or decreased every time the player performs any action that takes time, but with a bias to decreased speed, giving monsters a chance to get in some additional attacks. The effect of fast and very fast attributes is reversed while under the speed bug effect, so the player actually moves more slowly with speed boots than without.

^ rot13 trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the rot13 condition that displays as "A rot13 cypher has been activated for lowercase letters." on the enlightenment screen, and while under the effect all pline messages are mangled so they'll look like this: YBH UNIR N YVGGYR GEBHOYR YVSGVAT N +1 URNIL VEBA ONYY {1200}.

^ shades of grey trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the shades of grey condition that displays as "Everything displays in various shades of grey" on the enlightenment screen, and most items and other dungeon features will be displayed either white, gray or black, depending on their actual color. For player characters with infravision it disables color vision completely, which means monsters will also be displayed in shades of grey instead.

^ faint trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the fainting condition that displays as "You randomly faint" on the enlightenment screen, and there's a chance every turn for the player to simply faint with no explanation other than "You faint from exertion." while under the effect.

^ inventory trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the inventory loss condition that displays as "There is not enough memory to create an inventory window" on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, trying to open the inventory screen in any way (including hitting * or ? on prompts like "What do you want to eat?") displays "Not enough memory to create inventory window", and the inventory doesn't open. This makes it very hard to efficiently manage one's inventory, and performing actions that ask for an item become much harder to perform. Using scrolls of identify doesn't even allow the player to select anything.

^ thirst trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the thirst condition that displays as "You have a strong sense of thirst" on the enlightenment screen, and the bottom status line will no longer tell the player if they are hungry, weak or even fainting. Also while under the effect, satiated players can never be sleep resistant.

^ bishop trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the bishop condition that displays as "You cannot move diagonally." on the enlightenment screen, and the player will be restricted to using the four cardinal directions for a while, similar to being polymorphed into a grid bug.

^ luck trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the luck loss condition that displays as "You're shitting out of luck (SOL)" on the enlightenment screen, and whenever the game uses the rnl random number function to change an outcome depending on the player's current luck, the player's luck will silently be reduced by one point. If the player manages to exceed their maximum positive luck while under the effect, their luck will wrap around to the worst negative value; if that happens, there will be a message for the player but it's vague.

^ curse trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the item cursing condition that displays as "Your inventory gradually fills up with cursed items." on the enlightenment screen, and the player's items will randomly be cursed similar to Rodney's harassment on the ascension run for as long as the effect goes on.

^ drop trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the drop bug condition that displays as "You cannot drop items" on the enlightenment screen, and the player will be completely unable to drop any item while under the effect. Other means of getting rid of items, like throwing or allowing nymphs to steal them, will still work though.

^ sudden confusion trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the confusing problem condition that displays as "You have a confusing problem" on the enlightenment screen, and whenever the player reads a scroll while under the effect, it will have the confused effects. This makes reading random scrolls very dangerous, since genocide will instakill a non-polymorphed player with no chance of life saving!

^ alignment trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the bad alignment condition that displays as "Your maximum alignment will decrease over time." on the enlightenment screen, and the player's maximum alignment will decrease over time rather than increase for as long as the effect goes on. This may eventually lead to a negative maximum alignment, resulting in the player's prayers always failing.

^ stairs trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the trapped staircases condition that displays as "Stairs are always trapped." on the enlightenment screen, and whenever the player takes a staircase while the effect is active, upon emerging on the new level they are immediately surrounded by monsters. Stairs traps also prevent players from going back for a couple turns: before obtaining the amulet, the use of upstairs is prevented; with the amulet in the player's possession, downstairs cannot be used.

^ uninformation trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the uninformation condition that displays as "The game gives insufficient amounts of information." on the enlightenment screen, and as long as the effect is active, all items will have very crude descriptions that don't tell what they actually are. So "a blessed fireproof scroll of scare monster named Emergency Backup" will just display "a scroll", for example. Egotype monsters are also no longer highlighted yellow and don't have the egotype descriptions appended to their name, although their egotypes will still be in effect.

^ intrinsic loss trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the intrinsic loss condition that displays as "You have a case of random intrinsic loss." on the enlightenment screen, and every once in a while you might lose a random intrinsic.

^ blood loss trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the blood loss condition that displays as "You are bleeding out." on the enlightenment screen, and while under the effect, you randomly take bleedout damage. Occasionally the game will increase the average bleedout damage, or damage your maximum HP. Refer to Bleeder for more information.

^ bad effect trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the bad effects condition that displays as "You are subjected to random bad effects." on the enlightenment screen, and while the effect is active, random bad stuff will happen to you.

^ multiplicator trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the trap creation condition that displays as "You are more likely to encounter traps." on the enlightenment screen, and the game will randomly create traps while it's active. Additionally, the initial triggering of this trap also creates a couple new traps.

^ automatic vulnerability trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the vulnerability condition that displays as "You have the risk of temporarily losing intrinsics." on the enlightenment screen, and while it's active, every once in a while a random intrinsic is deactivated for a period of time, meaning that you simply cannot have the property in question, neither intrinsically nor extrinsically.

^ teleporting items trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the itemporting condition that displays as "You have teleporting items." on the enlightenment screen, and while under the effect, your items may occasionally be teleported to any random empty location on the current level, which is to say they won't be in your inventory anymore, and there is no message if it happens!

^ nastiness trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the nastiness condition that displays as "You are subjected to random nasty trap effects." on the enlightenment screen, and while the condition is active, you will randomly gain from the effects of any other random nasty trap on this page every once in a while!

^ respawn trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the respawning condition that displays as "Killing monsters will cause them to respawn somewhere on the level." on the enlightenment screen, and whenever a monster is killed while it is active, there's an 80% chance that a monster of the same type is generated somewhere on the level, a 10% chance that two monsters of that type are generated, and the remaining 10% nothing happens. This, coupled with the natural monster respawn rate, can cause dungeon levels to become crowded very quickly, and it includes boss monsters and even the Riders too, so you may end up with a dozen hostile Death clones on the Astral Plane! However, some players might want to abuse this trap for sacfesting, especially if crossaligned unicorns are around.

^ captcha trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the captcha condition that displays as "You sometimes have to solve captchas." on the enlightenment screen, and every once in a while the player will have to solve a captcha. Failure to do so will reduce the maximum HP and Pw and paralyze the character for a few turns.

^ farlook trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the farlook bug condition that displays as "Farlooking peaceful monsters angers them." on the enlightenment screen, and if the player tries to farlook a monster that is peaceful but not tame, the monster in question becomes hostile.

^ amnesia trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the recurring amnesia condition that displays as "You are going to suffer from amnesia now and then." on the enlightenment screen, and as long as it's active, you will randomly suffer from amnesia and have your map/item knowledge wiped.

^ bigscript trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the bigscript condition that displays as "You have BIGscript." on the enlightenment screen, and while the effect lasts, ALL MESSAGES ON THE TOP LINE ARE DISPLAYED IN ALL CAPS.

^ bank trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the bank bug condition that displays as "Your money will wander into a mysterious bank." on the enlightenment screen, and money in your open inventory will automatically disappear while the effect is active. Even zero-turn actions aren't safe from this, so you can't quickly put money into a container after picking it up. The money isn't deleted completely, though; rather, the game saves the amount you stored, and if you reach a predetermined random limit, a (very difficult) boss monster will spawn on the level, holding all the gold. Kill it to get it back, but beware - if the trap effect is still active, you'll just lose all the money again, so make sure you kill the boss after it has timed out!

^ map trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the map bug condition that displays as "The map doesn't display correctly." on the enlightenment screen, and regular dungeon floors are invisible while it's active.

^ tech trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the technique bug condition that displays as "Your techniques don't work." on the enlightenment screen, and trying to use a technique while it's active will fail, setting the technique in question on a lengthy timeout without producing any effects.

^ disenchantment trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the recurring disenchantment condition that displays as "Your possessions disenchant themselves spontaneously." on the enlightenment screen, and as long as it's active, you will randomly get the message "Your equipment seems less effective". This tries to disenchant stuff in your main inventory. Wands, spellbooks and magic markers all count as being enchanted for this purpose and may lose charges, and of course your weapons and armor may also get disenchanted.

^ verisiert! - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the rapid respawn condition that displays as "Monster respawn speeds up rapidly." on the enlightenment screen, and as long as the effect is active, natural monster respawn rate is much faster than it would otherwise be.

^ chaos trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the chaos terrain condition that displays as "The terrain slowly becomes ever more chaotic." on the enlightenment screen, and random normal floor tiles will become ice, water, lava, trees, air or iron bars while the effect is active.

^ muteness trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the muteness condition that displays as "You're completely unable to cast spells." on the enlightenment screen, and trying to cast a spell while under the effect fails without using up turns or mana.

^ engraving trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the disengraving condition that displays as "Monsters don't respect Elbereth." on the enlightenment screen, and Elbereth doesn't scare monsters while the effect is active.

^ magical device trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the device bug condition that displays as "Zapping a wand can cause it to explode." on the enlightenment screen, and while it's active, any wands zapped by the player have a significant chance of exploding.

^ book trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the book bug condition that displays as "Reading spellbooks confuses you." on the enlightenment screen, and if you read a spellbook while the effect is active, you will be confused first. This has a large chance of you not being able to learn the spell contained in the book, and sometimes you might also destroy the book!

^ level trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the level bug condition that displays as "Monsters become stronger if many of their species have been generated already." on the enlightenment screen, and whenever a new monster is generated while the effect is active, that monster will be higher in level (and therefore have more HP, hit dice etc.) if many of its species have been generated already. This can allow gnomish wizards to be high enough in level to cast touch of death!

^ quiz trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the quiz condition that displays as "You have to partake in the Great NetHack Quiz." on the enlightenment screen, and every once in a while the game will give you a NetHack-related question that you have to answer correctly. If the wrong answer is given, you suffer from a random bad effect.

^ metabolism trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the fast metabolism condition that displays as "Your food consumption is much faster." on the enlightenment screen, and while under the effect, you hunger much more rapidly.

^ trap of no return - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the anti-teleportation condition that displays as "You cannot teleport at all." on the enlightenment screen, and as long as it's active, you cannot teleport. This includes intra-level teleportation, level teleportation and branchporting.

^ egotrap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the egoism condition that displays as "Monsters always spawn with egotypes." on the enlightenment screen, and all newly generated monsters will always have at least one egotype.

^ fast forward trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the fast forward condition that displays as "Time goes by faster." on the enlightenment screen, and the turn counter will advance more quickly while it's active. The main effect of this is that if you're going for a speed ascension, you might not be able to successfully do it and end up with an average-turncount ascension instead.

^ trap of rottenness - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the rotten food condition that displays as "Your food is always rotten." on the enlightenment screen, and as long as the effect is active, eating anything will always cause it to be rotten.

^ unskilled trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the unskilling condition that displays as "Your skills are deactivated." on the enlightenment screen, and while the effect is active, the game treats all of your skills as if they were unskilled.

^ low stats trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the low stats condition that displays as "All of your stats are lowered." on the enlightenment screen, which temporarily lowers your stats by 10 points.

^ training trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the failed training condition that displays as "You cannot train skills." on the enlightenment screen, and if you do any action that would train a skill while the effect is active, the skill's training counter doesn't actually go up.

^ exercise trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the failed exercise condition that displays as "You cannot exercise your stats." on the enlightenment screen, and if you do any action that would exercise a stat while the effect is active, the stat's exercise counter doesn't actually go up. But you can still abuse your stats, and are therefore likely to lose stat points over time.

^ limitation trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the turn limitation condition that displays as "You are getting your ascension turn limit reduced whenever you take damage." on the enlightenment screen, and losing hit points while under the effect reduces the time limit for ascension by the same number of turns. If you exceed the limit and still haven't ascended yet, the RNG will make random bad stuff happen to make your life hard, and those effects get more frequent the more you exceed the limit.

^ weak sight - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the weak sight condition that displays as "You are short-sighted." on the enlightenment screen, and your line of sight is reduced to 0 tiles while the effect is active. This means you cannot see unlit tiles until you actually step on them, but unlike blindness, you can still see things that are on lit tiles and recognize items.

^ random message trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the random messages condition that displays as "You are reading random messages." on the enlightenment screen, and while active, it has a large chance of replacing messages with random ones. This means you might not see actually important messages like "You are turning into a green slime" or "You feel deathly sick."!

^ desecration trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the desecration condition that displays as "Altars malfunction whenever you try to use them." on the enlightenment screen, and dropping stuff on an altar or otherwise interacting with it while under the effect has a much greater chance of removing the altar. Even if the altar doesn't get removed, it might summon a bunch of monsters that don't drop corpses, or cause other negative effects.

^ starvation trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the starvation condition that displays as "You are not going to get corpses from defeated enemies." on the enlightenment screen, and monsters don't drop corpses while the effect is active. An exception is monsters that revive, e.g. trolls, whose corpses will always revive instantly.

^ dropless trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the dropless condition that displays as "You are not going to get death drops from monsters." on the enlightenment screen, and monsters don't generate death drops when killed while under the effect. They may still drop the stuff they started with, though.

^ low effect trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the low effects condition that displays as "You have reduced power of magical effects." on the enlightenment screen, and if you use stuff that runs through the resist() function while the effect is active, the effect level will always be very low. Examples include checking whether a ring of conflict affects monsters, or whether a monster resists a force bolt spell, or whether a wand of polymorph will actually polymorph a monster.

^ invisible trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the invisible traps condition that displays as "You are not going to see traps." on the enlightenment screen, and all traps that are generated while you're under this effect will be completely invisible. There is no way to make such traps invisible, so if you enter the Elemental Planes while under the effect, you need to step on each square hoping to stumble into the magic portal.

^ ghost world trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the ghost world condition that displays as "You are in a ghost world." on the enlightenment screen, and newly generated monsters while under the effect are completely invisible. Having see invisible doesn't help, although you can still see them via telepathy or other methods. If you don't have such methods to see monsters, good luck.

^ dehydration trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the dehydration condition that displays as "You are going to become dehydrated." on the enlightenment screen, and while it's active, you have to regularly drink or you'll eventually suffer from hallucinations that do not end until you drink something.

^ hate trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the hate condition that displays as "Pets hate you with a fiery passion." on the enlightenment screen, and trying to tame monsters while under the effect will not work.

^ totter trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the totter condition that displays as "Your directional keys got swapped." on the enlightenment screen, and as long as it's active, all your directional keys are reversed. So you need to e.g. press left if you want to move to the right.

^ nonintrinsical trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the nonintrinsic condition that displays as "You are unable to get intrinsics from eating corpses." on the enlightenment screen, and eating corpses while under the effect will never grant positive intrinsics like poison resistance or telepathy. However, bad effects still apply, so eating cockatrices will still petrify you, and eating kittens will still give aggravate monster.

^ dropcurse trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the dropcurse condition that displays as "Dropping items causes them to autocurse." on the enlightenment screen, and if you drop an item while under the effect, it instantly becomes cursed. Throwing or firing something counts as dropping it, too.

^ nakedness trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the nakedness condition that displays as "You are effectively naked." on the enlightenment screen, and as long as the effect is active, your AC is always 10 regardless of the amount of armor you're wearing, so monsters will almost always hit you.

^ antilevel trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the anti-experience condition that displays as "You are unable to gain experience." on the enlightenment screen, and while under the effect, you cannot gain experience points. The only way to level up in that case may be consorting with foocubi or using potions of gain level.

^ stealer trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the itemstealing condition that displays as "You are more likely to have your items stolen." on the enlightenment screen, and while under the effect, nymphs and similar item-stealing monsters don't need to pass a saving throw to steal your stuff.

^ rebellion trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the rebellion condition that displays as "Pets can spontaneously rebel and become hostile." on the enlightenment screen, and as long as it's active, your pets may randomly become hostile.

^ crap trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the diarrhea condition that displays as "You have diarrhea." on the enlightenment screen, and if you are satiated while under the effect, you will randomly have to take a shit, which paralyzes you for a few turns. The time required to take off your armor and/or cloak gets added to the paralysis duration.

^ misfire trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the misfiring condition that displays as "Your projectiles often misfire." on the enlightenment screen, and throwing or firing a ranged weapon while the effect is active will often cause it to fly in a random, unintended, direction.

^ trap of walls - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the wall trap condition that displays as "Dungeon regrowth is excessively fast." on the enlightenment screen, and while under the effect, squares that have been dug out will turn back into solid rock much faster. Also, random solid rock tiles will be appearing more often in places that used to have open floor. Be sure to always carry a pick-axe or have another way of dealing with walls.

^ black ng wall trap - short for "black nothing-goes wall". Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the black ng wall condition that displays as "Blacky and his NG walls are closing in." on the enlightenment screen, and a hostile Blacky is summoned somewhere on the current dungeon level. This is the "grand daddy" of all nasty traps, for unlike the other nasty traps, the timeout caused by this trap is actually a delayed instakill. Upon triggering the trap, the timer is set to 500 - (current level difficulty * 3) (doubled for Geeks, quadrupled for Graduates), and if the timer runs out, the player takes damage equal to their maximum amount of hit points. A polymorphed player takes damage equal to their maximum amount of polymorphed hit points first. It's still possible for this damage to be reduced (about 33% chance), so if all else fails the player can hope to survive on random chance, and the damage while polymorphed undergoes a separate check so polymorphing actually increases the chance of survival by a fairly large amount. In order to stop the timer, the player needs to kill the Blacky or allow it to be killed by something. A side effect of this trap is that the entire screen display becomes monochrome, displaying all glyphs in a black color to indicate that something is wrong; however, if the player is also hallucinating, the hallucination colors overwrite the monochrome ones.

^ superscroller trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the superscroller condition that displays as "You have the superscroller." on the enlightenment screen, and glyphs on the screen randomly disappear while under the effect. This makes it very difficult to play the game, but there will always be an "active superscroller trap" generated on the current dungeon level that can be untrapped to reverse the superscroller effect. Stepping into an active superscroller trap while not under the superscroller effect will trigger it, though.

^ automatic switcher - Stepping on it works like a switcher except there's no message; that means, all the nasty trap effects a player is currently suffering from are cancelled, and the automatic switcher disappears. Triggering it while not being under any nasty trap effect doesn't remove it, so if the player finds one, they should remember its location so they can come back later when it's really needed.

^ an unknown trap - upon triggering this trap, it randomly transforms into any other random trap which is then automatically triggered by the player. It can be untrapped though (20% base chance of success), in which case the player gains 5 points of experience and has a random item appear beneath their feet.

^ trap %s - triggering this trap displays a random rumor with a bias towards false ones, and it has a 10% chance of transforming into a rock trap which doesn't trigger automatically on the same turn. The trap %s can be untrapped, rewarding the player with 1 point of experience.

^ super nupesell nix area - a trap that usually cannot be triggered by the player at all, since it blocks movement. If the player somehow manages to get onto its square (e.g. by using #jump or the air dash technique), it has no effect. The main purpose of this trap is to prevent the player from stepping onto a square whether the trap is visible or not; monsters can freely walk over it as long as it's not on a terrain type that they can't pass.

^ Only %a%s can go there! - Stepping on this trap randomly deletes items on the floor of the current dungeon level, with no message. Invocation tools and other critical items (ones that would make the game unwinnable if they are lost) are immune.

^ ntll - Triggering this trap displays a prompt that reads "nt|| - Not a valid save file". It is deliberately made to look as if it only accepts the "y" answer, but in reality, any answer other than "n" paralyzes the player for 127 turns and is thus a technical instadeath, like running into a floating eye in vanilla NetHack.

^ spacewars trap - Only triggers once, and creates random nasty traps and monsters that would spawn in arabella rooms on the current dungeon level. There is a 1% chance that this trap also displays the message "You see:" when triggered, otherwise there is no message at all.

^ disconnect trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the disconnected stairs condition that displays as "Staircases are disconnected." on the enlightenment screen, and then going to another dungeon level will place the player on a random location, as opposed to on the staircase.

^ interface screw trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the interface screw condition that displays as "The main game display does not update automatically." on the enlightenment screen, which means that the game window updates only if the player presses Ctrl-R to refresh the screen.

^ bossfight trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the bossfight condition that displays as "Boss monsters spawn much more often." on the enlightenment screen, and then random boss monsters have a much higher than usual chance of spawning.

^ entire level trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the entire level condition that displays as "Monster types that used to be rare are common now." on the enlightenment screen, and then the "uncommon by factor X" flags for monsters are ignored, meaning that all the monsters that would only spawn rarely become effectively more common. Since these are usually more dangerous than common monsters, this is likely to result in the game becoming much harder.

^ bones trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the bones level change condition that displays as "You always find or leave bones levels if possible." on the enlightenment screen. While under that effect, if the player comes to a new dungeon level that has a bones level saved to disk, it is guaranteed to load the bones file, and dying on a bones-eligible level will always cause the player to leave a new bones level.

^ autocurse trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the autocursing equipment condition that displays as "Every item you put on automatically curses itself." on the enlightenment screen, causing all equipment that the player puts on to automatically curse itself.

^ highlevel trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the highlevel status condition that displays as "Higher-level monsters are more likely to spawn." on the enlightenment screen, which disables the reduction in spawn chance that's usually in effect for higher level monsters. This means that on average, more high-level monsters are being spawned, potentially making the game harder.

^ spell forgetting trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the spell forgetting condition that displays as "Your spell memory decreases rapidly." on the enlightenment screen, and then the player's spell memory for all spells decays ten times as fast. This trap effect also disables the warning messages when a known spell has only little memory left.

^ sound effect trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the sound effect bug condition that displays as "Things that happen will play 'sound effects'." on the enlightenment screen. This trap has mostly cosmetic effects as certain in-game events will display additional messages that are supposed to be onomatopoeias of sound effects.

^ lootcut trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the lootcut effect that displays as "Monsters delete their musable items when killed." on the enlightenment screen. While under that effect, monsters that spawned with musable items will delete those items upon death instead of dropping them.

^ monster speed trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the monster speed bug effect that displays as "Monsters are moving faster." on the enlightenment screen. While under that effect, all monsters have 50% chance per turn to move 50% faster than they normally would.

^ scaling trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the scaling bug effect that displays as "Minimum monster level depends on your current depth." on the enlightenment screen. While under that effect, the minimum level for randomly spawned monsters is half the value of the maximum possible monster level (normally it would be zero, regardless of the value of the maximum).

^ enmity trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the enmity effect that displays as "Monsters always spawn hostile." on the enlightenment screen. While under that effect, newly spawned monsters are generally hostile even when they're of a species that would normally be always peaceful.

^ quasar trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the quasar vision effect that displays as "You can barely see the quasars." on the enlightenment screen. While under that effect, only certain tiles are visible, everything else displays as a blank square even if it's inside the player's field of view; it's randomized per dungeon level which tiles will be visible.

^ momma trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the momma bug effect that displays as "Your momma will repeatedly be insulted." on the enlightenment screen. While under that effect, the game displays random "your momma" jokes, and the MSGTYPE option can no longer be used to hide messages.

^ horror trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the horror bug effect that displays as "You will repeatedly get hit with status effects." on the enlightenment screen. While under that effect, the player repeatedly gets hit with cursed unicorn horn effects, which can cause status effects, attribute loss and sickness.

^ artificer trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the artificer bug effect that displays as "You will be forced to equip evil artifacts." on the enlightenment screen. While under that effect, there's a 1 in 2000 chance per turn that the player is forced to equip a bad artifact.

^ wereform trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the wereform bug effect that displays as "You randomly polymorph into werecreatures." on the enlightenment screen. While under that effect, the player occasionally transforms into a random werecreature.

^ non-prayer trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the nonprayer bug effect that displays as "Your prayer timeout goes up instead of down." on the enlightenment screen. While under that effect, the player's prayer timeout goes up over time instead of down, making it basically impossible to pray successfully.

^ evil patch trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the evil patch effect that displays as "You will get nasty trap effects intrinsically over time." on the enlightenment screen. While under that effect, there's a 1 in 2000 chance per turn that the player receives a random nasty trap effect intrinsically, which means it won't time out and can only be cured with a switcher.

^ hard mode trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the hard mode effect that displays as "All damage you take is doubled." on the enlightenment screen. While under that effect, the player takes double damage and therefore effectively has half as many HP as the status line says.

^ secret attack trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the secret attack bug effect that displays as "Monsters occasionally use their secret attacks." on the enlightenment screen. While under that effect, monster attacks that just deal plain physical damage have a 1% chance of turning into any random other damage type, like monsters with the "random attack" type.

^ eater trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the eater bug effect that displays as "Monsters can eat all items they encounter." on the enlightenment screen. While under that effect, monsters are capable of eating every item they move over (except indestructible ones like the Amulet of Yendor, obviously). When a monster eats something in this way outside of the player's field of view, the game says "You hear a chewing sound."

^ covetousness trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the covetousness bug effect that displays as "Covetous monster AI fires each turn." on the enlightenment screen. While under that effect, monsters with covetous AI will use that AI every turn, as opposed to having only a 1 in 10 chance of using it.

^ not seen trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the not seen bug effect that displays as "The walls became invisible." on the enlightenment screen. While under that effect, wall tiles are no longer displayed. This affects both the walls of rooms as well as solid rock tiles.

^ dark mode trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the dark mode bug effect that displays as "Lit tiles aren't visible unless you would also see them if they were unlit." on the enlightenment screen. While under that effect, permanently lit areas behave like unlit areas for the player, i.e. they aren't seen at a distance; however, temporary light sources like candles or lamps still work.

^ antisearch trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the antisearch effect that displays as "The search command never finds anything." on the enlightenment screen. While under that effect, using the search command does nothing, i.e. it can't find traps, doors or corridors anymore.

^ homicide trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the homicide effect that displays as "Monsters build new traps for you to blunder into." on the enlightenment screen. While under that effect, every newly spawned monster will create a new random trap underneath its spawn location unless there already is a trap on that square.

^ nasty nation trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the nastynation bug effect that displays as "All trap types except beneficial ones are equally likely to generate." on the enlightenment screen. While under that effect, all detrimental traps that would normally have reduced spawning chances will no longer have that spawn chance reduction, meaning they're all equally likely to generate. Since traps are normally more rare the more detrimental they are, this results in the player encountering much more dangerous traps on average.

^ wakeup call trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the wakeup call bug effect that displays as "Peaceful monsters may spontaneously turn hostile." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, every peaceful monster on the current dungeon level has a 1 in 10000 chance of spontaneously turning hostile whenever it moves.

^ grayout trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the grayout bug effect that displays as "The display intermittently becomes all gray." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, the game display always becomes covered with gray # glyphs for 5 turns, followed by 10 turns of regular display; this cycle repeats as long as the trap effect goes on. During the turns that have the player's vision obscured by the # glyphs, areas the player explores are not marked as seen; most notably this includes unseen water or lava squares.

^ gray center trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the gray center bug effect that displays as "Your immediate surroundings are obscured by a gray shroud." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, the player's current location as well as the eight surrounding squares are obscured by a gray # glyph. This can be extremely dangerous in dark areas if the player doesn't have a light source, because adjacent squares don't get marked as seen even if they contain water or lava!

^ checkerboard trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the checkerboard bug effect that displays as "Only one color of checkerboard tiles is ever visible at any given time." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, half of the playing field is obscured by gray # glyphs; these are arranged in a checkerboard pattern, which switches back and forth every turn. It should be noted that squares obscured by gray # glyphs are not marked as seen, even if they contain water or lava.

^ clockwise spin trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the clockwise spin bug effect that displays as "Your directional keys are shifted 45 degrees clockwise." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, directional input is rotated 45 degrees clockwise, so hitting the key to move north will move the character northeast, hitting northeast moves east and so on.

^ counterclockwise spin trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the counterclockwise spin bug effect that displays as "Your directional keys are shifted 90 degrees counterclockwise." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, directional input is rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise, so hitting the key to move north will move the character west, hitting northeast moves northwest and so on.

^ lag trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the lag bug effect that displays as "The game lags." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, every time the player enters any command (movement, opening inventory etc.), there's a 1 in 3 chance that their input is simply discarded.

^ blesscurse trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the blesscurse effect that displays as "Picking up a blessed item instantly curses it." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, picking up a blessed item will instantly curse it.

^ de-light trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the delight bug effect that displays as "Tiles that you're walking on automatically become unlit." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, lit tiles that the player character stands on will automatically become unlit.

^ discharge trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the discharge bug effect that displays as "If you use wands or tools that have charges, more charges are used up than normal." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, zapping a wand or using a charged tool uses up two charges per use instead of one.

^ trashing trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the trashing bug effect that displays as "If you equip enchanted weapons, armor or rings, their enchantment value decreases." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, putting on any equipment that has an enchantment value above -10 will reduce the enchantment value by one.

^ filtering trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the filtering bug effect that displays as "Certain messages may be replaced with generic ones." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, messages that start with "You", "Your", "You feel", "You can't", "The" or "There" don't display on the top line, and are instead replaced with random messages.

^ deformatting trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the deformatting bug effect that displays as "Your pokedex doesn't work." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, the pokedex used when farlooking a monster displays "Pokedex communication failure. Damn." and doesn't show the monster's stats.

^ flicker strip trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the flicker strip bug effect that displays as "The bottom status line only displays garbage strings." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, the bottom status lines are replaced with fleecy-colored garbage strings; when looking closely, the player can still see their HP and Pw values, and pressing Ctrl-X shows some additional information that would normally be visible on the status line too.

^ undressing trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the undressing effect that displays as "You spontaneously take off equipment." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, every equipped item that isn't cursed has an independent 1 in 10000 chance per turn to be taken off; most of the time there is no message when that happens.

^ hyperbluewall trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the hyperbluewalls effect that displays as "Walls are blue, and walking into them hurts you." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, walls and solid rock are displayed with a bright blue color, and bumping into a wall (which normally does nothing) now deals d10 damage and has a chance (lower if the player is wearing a helmet) of damaging intelligence or wisdom, or rarely it can also cause amnesia.

^ nolite trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the nolite bug effect that displays as "Staircases and object piles are no longer highlighted." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, tiles can no longer be highlighted if there is something special on that square (e.g. a pile of objects, a staircase obscured by an item, or a monster with egotypes).

^ paranoia trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the paranoia bug effect that displays as "There is no confirmation if you walk into traps, water or lava." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, walking into water or lava gives no confirmation prompt anymore, and neither does attempting to walk into other harmful terrain or known traps. Also, bumping into a peaceful monster will cause the player to attack, but bumping into a tame one still displaces it as normal.

^ fleecescript trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the fleecescript bug effect that displays as "Inventory item descriptions appear in fleecy colors, which is actually not all that problematic. :-)" on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, the player's inventory screen, spellcasting menu, and also many other menus including the options, techniques etc., display each line in a random color. If the player is additionally hallucinating, it can happen that every single letter is fleecy-colored.

^ interrupt trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the interrupt effect that displays as "The read, quaff, zap and apply commands now take several turns to use and can be interrupted." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, every act of reading, quaffing, zapping or applying an item will paralyze the player for a few turns.

^ dustbin trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the dustbin bug effect that displays as "If you pick up a scroll, it may disintegrate." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, trying to pick up a scroll has 50% chance of simply deleting the scroll.

^ mana battery trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the mana battery bug effect that displays as "You are a living mana battery." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, picking up a wand will reduce its amount of charges by a random amount, or if it was already out of charges, the wand becomes cancelled.

^ monsterfingers trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the monsterfingers effect that displays as "Picking up potions may break them and subject you to their vapors." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, trying to pick up a potion has 33% chance of breaking the potion, which subjects the player to its vapors.

^ miscast trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the miscast bug effect that displays as "Casting a spell always causes backlash, regardless of whether the spell worked." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, every time the player tries to cast a spell, a random bad effect happens.

^ message suppression trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the message suppression effect that displays as "The top status line doesn't display anything." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, the top status line never displays any messages; this includes prompts such as "Really walk into the lava?" or "What do you wish for?".

^ stuck announcement trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the stuck announcement effect that displays as "The bottom status line only updates if you explicitly tell it to do so." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, the bottom status line will not update as the game goes on, but only if the player presses Ctrl-R.

^ bloodthirsty trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the bloodthirsty effect that displays as "There is no confirmation if you walk into a peaceful monster." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect and wielding a weapon, walking into a peaceful monster will cause the player to attack, similar to the effects of wielding Stormbringer.

^ maximum damage trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the maximum damage bug effect that displays as "Monster attacks always deal maximum damage to you." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, monsters whose attacks deal xdy damage will always deal the maximum (x*y) amount of damage if they hit the player, so e.g. a large dog (which normally deals 2d4 damage) will always deal the maximum 8 damage.

^ latency trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the latency bug effect that displays as "There is background latency." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, every time the player enters a command (such as a directional movement key or opening the inventory), the game lags for a small random amount of frames before it processes the input.

^ starlit trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the starlit bug effect that displays as "All monsters look the same and you can't tell them apart." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, all monsters look like gray # glyphs and messages that involve their name will replace the monster's actual name with "monster", making it impossible to see their true identity.

^ knowledge trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the knowledge bug effect that displays as "All traps look the same and you can't tell them apart." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, all traps look like fleecy-colored # glyphs and the ^ command will only say "This is a trap." The warning message when walking into a known trap will also no longer say what type of trap it is.

^ highscore trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the highscore bug effect that displays as "The game continuously spawns spacewars monsters and nasty traps." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, there's a 1 in 300 chance per turn that the game either makes a nasty trap or an insideroom monster somewhere on the current level; the latter can be division jedis, huge ogre thieves or other really dangerous monsters who can instakill the player.

^ EVC trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the evencore effect that displays as "The game will spawn fake invisible monster markers." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, every time the player enters a command, even one that doesn't take time like opening the inventory or an invalid command, a fake I marker (usually reserved for showing the location of unseen monsters) spawns somewhere on the screen. It's generally considered a bad idea to dispel them by walking into them, because doing so wastes a turn; instead, use Ctrl-U or #removeimarkers to get rid of them without using in-game time.

^ underlayer trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the underlayer bug effect that displays as "Invisible monster markers are not visible, but bumping into them uses up a turn." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, I markers that denote the remembered location of unseen monsters are no longer displayed on the screen, but the player loses a turn (and doesn't attack even if there is actually a monster on that square) when bumping into such an invisible I marker.

^ damage meter trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the damage meter bug effect that displays as "The game won't tell you exactly how much damage an attack does." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, the top status line won't say how much damage the player took when losing HP.

^ arbitrary weight trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the arbitrary weight bug effect that displays as "You can't see your carry capacity or the weight of items." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, the bottom status line no longer displays how much an item weighs, and item weights are no longer displayed in inventory either.

^ fucked info trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the fucked info bug effect that displays as "You can't see what character you are playing." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, the bottom status line no longer displays what character class the player is, and Ctrl-X won't display it either.

^ heap trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the heap effect bug effect that displays as "Messages are repeated randomly." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, every message on the top status line is repeated a random number of times, creating many additional --More-- prompts especially when the messages are long, and since it's not possible to predict how many repetitions of a message there'll be, this can lead to the player skipping past a message with an actual prompt such as "Really attack Izchak? (y/n)" because only the last repetition of such a message will actually prompt the player for input.

^ tron trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the tron effect that displays as "You can't walk in the same direction twice in a row." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, the player cannot use the same movement direction they used during their previous turn, which includes but is not limited to movement, directional attacks, and direction prompts when e.g. using a directional spell. Not using a direction at all during a turn resets the "last used direction" to "no direction", which is important if the player is trying to walk down a corridor (which usually requires the player to use the same direction repeatedly).

^ too heavy trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the too heavy effect that displays as "Picking up an item increases your carried weight by more than what the item weighs." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, picking up any item increases the player's carried weight by 50 in addition to what the item actually weighs, and the player's carried weight will slowly decrease back to its actual value. This effect stacks with every item the player picks up, and can therefore easily result in becoming burdened, especially if the player uses ranged weapons because picking them back up increases weight for every stack the player picks back up. It is important to know that the amount of stacked items picked up at once doesn't matter, so picking up a stack of 2 arrows only gives a weight increase of 50 while picking up two individual arrows on different tiles counts as two picked up items (even if they then stack), giving a weight increase of 100.

^ elongation trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the elongation bug effect that displays as "Monsters' hug attacks, ranged weapons and breaths can hit you from very far away." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, monsters can use ranged attacks from infinitely far away. This is particularly dangerous for monsters with hug attacks, because they will hit the player through walls and from the other end of the map, whereas stuff like thrown darts or arrows shot with a bow will require a clear firing lane with the monster lined up with the player, but those will also have infinite distance.

^ wrapover trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the wrapover effect that displays as "Your positively enchanted items may randomly turn into negatively enchanted ones." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, every positively enchanted item in the player's open inventory has a 1 in 40000 chance per turn to become negatively enchanted, so e.g. a +2 dagger will become a -2 dagger.

^ destruction trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the destruction effect that displays as "Item destruction may happen randomly." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, there is a 1 in 100 chance per turn that the player's inventory is hit by fire, cold, shock or poison, determined randomly.

^ melee prefix trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the melee prefix bug effect that displays as "If you simply walk into monsters to attack, you lose a turn." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, bumping into a monster won't attack it, but instead says "You bump into <monster>.", causing you to lose a turn without harming the monster. The F command needs to be used to attack a monster while this trap effect is active; simply bumping into a monster repeatedly "wondering why it doesn't seem to die" (and continuing to do so even when the monster is about to kill you) is a terrible idea.

^ automore trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the automore bug effect that displays as "There are no --More-- prompts." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, --More-- prompts are cleared automatically, so if there's several messages separated by such prompts, they fly by so fast that they're impossible to read, and the previous message command also doesn't work anymore so the player is rather likely to miss important messages.

^ unfair attack trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the unfair attack bug effect that displays as "Monsters will occasionally use very unfair attacks on you." on the enlightenment screen. While under that effect, monster attacks that just deal plain physical damage have a 1% chance of turning into any random other damage type, like monsters with the "RNG intervention attack" type, which is more likely to roll the really dangerous attack types compared to the "random attack" type (so this trap is more dangerous than the secret attack trap).

^ trap of longing - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the longing effect that displays as "The game bombards you with 'sexy' messages." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, there is a 1 in 50 chance per turn that the top line displays a "sexy" message about some girl and how beautiful she is.

^ cursed part trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the cursed parts effect that displays as "Sometimes you're forced to wear cursed equipment." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, there is a 1 in 500 chance per turn that a random cursed piece of equipment is created and the player forcibly equips it, removing whatever equipment previously was in the slot occupied by the new one.

^ quaversal trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the quaversal effect that displays as "Unless you're standing on specific tiles, the entire screen is black." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, the entire playing field will go black if the player stands on certain squares, and only when standing on certain other squares the playing field will be visible. There is no indication what these tiles are, just like with the quasar trap.

^ appearance shuffling trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the appearance shuffling effect that displays as "The randomized appearances of items are occasionally shuffled." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, there is a 1 in 2000 chance per turn that randomized appearances of armor pieces, scrolls, potions etc. are re-shuffled; while this is mostly cosmetical, it can confuse players who have previously suffered amnesia and forgot item identifications, and the materials of certain items as well as the effect of some random appearances might also change. For example, healing potions that used to be smoky potions could randomly become milky potions when this effect triggers.

^ choiceless trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the choicelessness effect that displays as "Direction prompts often don't allow you to select anything." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, there is a chance that a directional prompt (e.g. when firing a ranged weapon or zapping a directional wand) doesn't let the player choose anything and instead goes in a random direction. The chance of not getting such a prompt is between 20% and 80%; the more Pw a player has remaining in relation to their maximum, the greater the chance that there is no prompt, meaning that the best chance of actually getting a prompt (important when e.g. trying to cast a healing spell on oneself) is when the player has only little Pw left.

^ goldspell trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the goldspells effect that displays as "You often can't choose which spell you want to cast." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, pressing Z to cast a spell has 90% chance of simply choosing a random spell that the player knows and casting it. If this selects a spell for which the player doesn't have enough mana, nothing happens, however it can also select a forgotten spell and attempt to cast that, potentially resulting in unwanted status effects. The player can use the #spelldelete command to delete unwanted spells from their list of spells (and thereby remove the risk of the goldspells effect selecting them), but this can only be done for forgotten spells.

^ deprovement trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the deprovement effect that displays as "Leveling up no longer increases your maximum HP and Pw." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, leveling up doesn't increase the player's maximum HP and Pw, except when the new experience level is below 10 and even then only with a certain chance that decreases the higher the new level is.

^ initialization trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the initialization fail effect that displays as "Prompts that let you choose an item will not appear." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, certain actions that result in a prompt letting the player pick an item (e.g. scrolls of identify) will not display a prompt, and may therefore end up being wasted with no effect.

^ gushlush trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the gushlush effect that displays as "To-hit, spellcasting chances and some other stuff always assume that you're experience level 1." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, many calculations that give stronger effects based on the player character's level will always act as if the player was experience level 1, which means that e.g. damage-dealing spells become much weaker. This trap only affects calculations where a higher experience level would be beneficial to the player character.

^ soiltype trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the soiltype effect that displays as "You trigger ground-based traps even while flying or levitating." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, the player will trigger ground-based traps like holes, pits, waterpools etc. even while flying or levitating.

^ dangerous terrain trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the dangerous terrains effect that displays as "Standing next to dangerous terrain may confuse or stun you with no warning." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, standing next to dangerous terrain has a chance for the player to suddenly be afflicted with stun and confusion; this chance is higher the more dangerous tiles are adjacent to the character. All of the following types of terrain count for this purpose: water, water tunnel, crystal water, moorland, shifting sand, lava, styx river, nether mist, stalactite and rain cloud. Also there is no message if this does result in being stunned and confused, so if the player is playing fast, they may well accidentally move and end up stepping into the harmful terrain tile.

^ fallout trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the fallout effect that displays as "Your contamination increases over time." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, there is a 1 in 100 chance per turn for the player to be contaminated by d10 points.

^ mojibake trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the mojibake effect that displays as "Some glyphs are randomized." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, glyphs on the playing field may randomly look like other glyphs, thereby obscuring what is really there and potentially confusing the player into thinking a monster, trap etc. was there when it really wasn't.

^ gravation trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the gravation effect that displays as "Random monster spawns use aggravate monster rules." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, randomly spawned monsters receive a bonus to the maximum level they can be, just like aggravate monster effects do, meaning the player is more likely to see higher-level monsters.

^ uncalled trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the uncalled effect that displays as "You can't give names to items or monsters." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, trying to use the call commands on monsters or items doesn't work; there isn't even any prompt when trying, the game just plain doesn't give a response.

^ exploding dice trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the exploding dice effect that displays as "Monster attacks use exploding dice for damage calculations." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, monsters attacking the player have an iterating 1 in 6 chance of adding the base damage of their attack to the total amount of damage they do, meaning they deal more damage on average and have an diminishing chance of doing much more than they normally would.

^ permacurse trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the permacurse effect that displays as "Many conventional methods of curse removal no longer work." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, certain methods of uncursing items (e.g. scrolls of remove curse) can no longer uncurse an item.

^ shrouded identity trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the shrouded identity effect that displays as "Identifying items is much harder." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, identifying an item has an unconditional 90% chance of failing, which is on top of any other random chances of not identifying the item.

^ feeler gauges trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the feeler gauges effect that displays as "Monsters always know where you are and come straight for you." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, monsters will always move towards the player, even if they can't see the player character and even if they're non-hostile or of a type that normally doesn't approach.

^ long screwup trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the long screwup effect that displays as "Triggering a nasty trap causes the effect to last for a really long time." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, any new nastytrap effect that hits the player will last 20 times as long as it normally would, and if the player gets a temporary effect of the long screwup trap, it will also last 20 times as long as other nasty trap types.

^ wing yellow changer - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the wing yellow change effect that displays as "You're forced to play with a different tileset." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, the game forces a screwy tileset where it's very difficult to see what the walls, floor, dungeon features etc. are.

^ life saving trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the life saving bug effect that displays as "Monsters occasionally lifesave when killed." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, hostile monsters have 20% chance of lifesaving when killed.

^ curseuse trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the curseuse effect that displays as "Any scroll, potion, spellbook, wand or tool you use automatically becomes cursed." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, using the read, quaff, zap or apply commands will curse the item selected by the player and only then actually proc the item's effect.

^ cut nutrition trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the cut nutrition effect that displays as "You gain much less nutrition than usual." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, gaining nutrition (e.g. from eating a comestible) will give the player only one third of the usual amount of nutrition.

^ skill loss trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the skill loss effect that displays as "Your skills will gradually lose training." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, every turn there's a chance that a random skill is picked, and its amount of skill training reduced if the player has actually trained it. Most of the time it reduces the amount of training in the affected skill by one, but there's also a 1 in 1000 chance that it's set to zero regardless of how much training the skill had. If this causes the player's training amount to go below the amount needed for the current skill level, the player's skill level will be reduced to match, and the skill point(s) refunded.

^ autopilot trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the autopilot effect that displays as "You're on autopilot." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, every time the player issues a command (including ones that don't take in-game time, such as opening the inventory or pushing a button that isn't actually mapped to any command) there is a chance that the player's command is discarded and a random command used instead; the random command has 90% chance of being a directional movement key and can otherwise be any from a number of other commands such as apply, eat, pay etc. There is always at least a 1% chance that the player's command is replaced with a random one, and the higher the player's contamination is, the more often it happens, capped at 50% (90% in evilvariant mode). Having at least 600 contamination has a 1% chance of displaying "Client <playername> sent a bogus command packet.", and while playing evilvariant mode this also causes the game to save and exit (forcing the player to load it again); having at least 1000 contamination additionally has a 1% chance of displaying "Client <playername> sent an unreadable command packet.", and while playing evilvariant mode this also ends the game with a DYWYPI. In the latter case, even life saving cannot save the player.

^ force trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the mysterious force effect that displays as "The dirty mysterious force full of dirt is back." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, going up a set of stairs has a chance of sending the player down instead, potentially for several levels; the effect is greatest for lawful characters and smallest for chaotic ones.

^ monster glyph trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the monster glyph change effect that displays as "Monsters rapidly change glyphs." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, monsters are displayed as random glyphs, similar to the hallucination status effect, and messages will always refer them as "monster" instead of their actual name, making it impossible for the player to know what monster they're actually fighting.

^ changing directive trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the changing directives effect that displays as "The directives you've given to your pets will change randomly." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, there's a 1 in 100 chance per turn that the behavior of the player's pets is changed: this can turn the ability of pets to collect items on or off, or make it so that the pet can attack everything, peaceful monsters only or no monsters at all, turn the pet's ability to eat food off the floor on or off, make it so that the pet does or doesn't try to follow the player, or change the odds for attacks to be redirected to a ridden steed to any value from 0% to 100%. If this trap causes the pet's behavior to change, the effect of that will persist even after the trap effect itself ends. Player characters without the directive technique/spell may well be completely unable to change the directives back to their original values.

^ container kaboom trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the container kaboom effect that displays as "Opening a container causes bad stuff to happen." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, opening any container causes effects similar to the ones that trapped containers can have; if this rolls the explosion effect, the actual container is unharmed, unlike real container traps.

^ steal degrade trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the steal degrading effect that displays as "If a monster steals your items, the stolen items are cursed and disenchanted." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, if an item-stealing monster manages to steal something from the player, the item in question is cursed and loses a point of enchantment (up to a minimum of -20).

^ left inventory trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the left inventory bug effect that displays as "Items that leave your inventory will be unidentified." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, items that leave the player's inventory (regardless of how, so this includes not only dropping the item but also putting it in a container, having it stolen by a monster etc.) may cause certain aspects of the item to be unidentified, which can affect the knowledge of the item's enchantment value, visible appearance, rustproofing-or-not, BUC status, or base type. Also, as long as this trap effect is active, dropping non-BUC-identified items on an altar does not train the spirituality skill.

^ fluctuating speed trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the fluctuating speed effect that displays as "Your movement speed fluctuates from extremely fast to ultra slow." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, the player's speed fluctuates in cycles of 60 turns, starting with extremely fast (5 times as fast as normal) speed at the first turn of a cycle and gradually becoming slower, until the player's speed becomes agonizingly slow for the last 10 turns of the cycle. This trap can be used to pull off strategies for outspeeding and thereby potentially killing otherwise difficult foes by fighting them during the fast part of the cycle, but caution is advised so that the player doesn't get swarmed and mugged by monsters during the super-slow part of the cycle.

^ tarmustrokingnora trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the tarmustrokingnora effect that displays as "Searching may cause a new trap to spawn." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, pressing the search button may cause a new trap to spawn at a random location on the current level, but only on walkable squares that don't have a trap on them yet. Whenever this effect triggers, a timer is set to a random number from 1 to 100, which is the amount of turns that have to pass before searching will create another trap, so the player cannot simply mash the search key and cause a trap to come into existence on every turn.

^ failure trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the failure effect that displays as "The messages 'nothing happens' or 'never mind' become dangerous." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, whenever the game displays the message "Nothing happens" or "Never mind", the player is hit by a random bad effect.

^ frequentation spawn trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the frequentation spawn effect that displays as "Some monster trait is more common than usual." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, a random specific monster trait (e.g. "monsters that have fire resistance" or "monsters that will follow you up and down stairs") is more common, meaning that randomly generated monsters have a higher chance of rolling ones that have the specified trait.

^ pet AI trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the pet AI screw effect that displays as "Your pets refuse to follow you." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, pets will no longer try to follow the player character, and instead walk around randomly. This can make it almost impossible to transfer them to different dungeon levels unless the player has a magic whistle, leash or saddle.

^ satan trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the satan effect that displays as "Satan made it so that changing dungeon levels paralyzes you for a turn." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, changing dungeon levels always paralyzes the player for one turn, which includes not only using stairs but also trap doors, level teleportation and other methods.

^ rememberance trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the rememberance effect that displays as "Spells with low spell memory are harder to cast." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, spells with less than 100% spell memory have their success rate multiplied by the amount of memory they have left, so e.g. a spell with 75% memory has 75% of the usual success chance. The lower a spell's remaining memory is, the harder it becomes to cast, as even a 100% success (=0% fail) spell will have only as much success chance as its spell memory, so the aforementioned spell with 75% spell memory will have 75% success chance (if it already had only 50% success chance before this trap effect, it'll then have 37% success chance and so on).

^ pokelie trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the pokelie effect that displays as "The pokedex lies to you." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, the pokedex shows wrong stats for monsters; it's deterministic what it displays, but re-randomized when the pokelie effect ends, so the next time it triggers, it'll display different wrong stats.

^ autopickup trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the always-autopickup effect that displays as "You always pick up items." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, walking over a tile with items on it will always cause the player to pick them up whether they want to or not; it is however possible to prefix movement with m to prevent that.

^ dywypi trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the dywypi problem effect that displays as "If you lifesave, you have to give the correct answer or you die anyway." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, dying will always display a DYWYPI prompt, even if the player has life saving. If any answer other than 'n' is given on that prompt, the player's game ends despite the life saving.

^ manler trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the manler effect that displays as "The manler is chasing you." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, a rapidly-changing faux monster is visible on the playing field that cannot be harmed in any way, and which moves once per game turn. Often it moves in a random direction, but it also has a 20% chance of specifically moving towards the player, so if the player waits for long enough, the faux monster will eventually catch them. Being caught by the faux monster causes the player to take a bunch of damage and get hit with 5 random effects, and then the faux monster teleports and starts chasing the player again.

^ doorning trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the doorning effect that displays as "Doors are dangerous." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, moving onto a door tile (regardless of the state of the door; this includes doorways that have no actual door) has 10% chance of hitting the player with various trap effects, including possibly blasts of fire, aggravate monster, lightning damage, water damage, a boulder falling on top of the player, or random bad effects. Additionally, the door square and the eight surrounding squares will be filled with random traps that cannot be made visible at all, which can be very dangerous.

^ nownsible trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the nownsible effect that displays as "Triggering a trap makes it invisible." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, triggering a trap causes it to become invisible, so it can never be made visible at all, which also means the act of triggering a trap no longer reveals it (so the player cannot untrap it either, in case it's a type of trap that can be untrapped).

^ elm street trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the elm street effect that displays as "The game behaves as if it were Friday the 13th." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, the game behaves as if it were Friday the 13th.

^ monnoise trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the monnoise effect that displays as "Monsters make noises." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, many monsters have a 1 in 250 chance per turn to make noises when they're near the player, some of which can also adversely affect the character.

^ rang call trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the rang call effect that displays as "The presence of boss monsters increases your sanity." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, every time a boss monster moves on the current dungeon level, there's a 5% chance that the player's sanity increases by one. This includes peaceful and tame boss monsters moving around.

^ recurring spell loss trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the recurring spell loss effect that displays as "You repeatedly lose spell memory." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, there's a 1 in 1000 chance per turn that the player loses spell memory in a randomly selected spell.

^ antitraining trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the antitraining effect that displays as "Your skill training is occasionally reduced." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, there's a 1 in 1000 chance per turn that one of the player's skills loses some training; this can cause a skill to be drained below the threshold for the current skill level, in which case the player's actual skill level is reduced and the skill point(s) refunded.

^ techout trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the techout bug effect that displays as "Your techniques may sometimes be put on timeout." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, there's a 1 in 1000 chance per turn that a random technique known by the player has its timeout increased.

^ stat decay trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the stat decay effect that displays as "Your stats will gradually decay." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, there's a 1 in 1000 chance per turn that one of the player's stats is permanently reduced by one, meaning the loss cannot be easily restored and instead needs to be trained back up the hard way.

^ movemork trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the movemork effect that displays as "Monsters are generated with movement energy." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, monsters will spawn with enough movement energy to make one move after being spawned (normally they'd have to wait a turn before they can move for the first time). If the player starts the game while under this trap effect, there's one turn of paralysis before the game starts.

^ bad part trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the bad part bug effect that displays as "You are in the bad part." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, there's a 1 in 20 chance per turn that the game picks a random tile on the current level, and if that tile is a diggable wall that doesn't have any neighboring door, regular floor or stair tiles, it turns into a random other type of terrain with a 1 in 40 chance of a random nasty trap being put on the new type of terrain.

^ completely bad part trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the completely bad part bug effect that displays as "You are in the completely bad part." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, there's a 1 in 5 chance per turn that the game picks a random tile on the current level, and if that tile is a diggable wall, it turns into a random other type of terrain with a 1 in 15 chance of a random nasty trap being put on the new type of terrain.

^ evil variant trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the evilvariant effect that displays as "You're forced to play the evil variant." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, the game behaves as if it was in evil variant mode.

^ sanity treble trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the sanity treble effect that displays as "Sanity effects will increase your sanity by a much higher amount than usual." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, every time the player's sanity increases, the amount of incoming sanity is multiplied by d20.

^ stat decrease trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the stat decrease bug effect that displays as "The soft cap for your attributes is much lower." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, the soft caps for the player's stats are reduced by 10, meaning that an attempt to increase them starts failing at a much lower value (the actual soft caps for stats are determined by both the character's role and race).

^ simeout trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the simeout bug effect that displays as "Your sanity slowly increases over time." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, there's a 1 in 2500 chance per turn for the player's sanity to increase by one, and sanity no longer times out on its own.

^ timerun trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the timerun bug effect that displays as "All actions take turns." on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, using any command, including e.g. opening the inventory or entering an invalid command (including pressing the space bar even with rest_on_space off) causes a turn to pass.
Spell color traps

This subset of nasty traps is characterized by the fact that only one of them can be active at a time; higher-tier spell color traps suppress lower-tier ones.

Traps in this category are given in descending order, meaning that if the player triggers several of them, the one at the top of this list will be in effect while the lower ones are suppressed until the one at the top times out (however, the timeouts are in fact running for the suppressed ones too).

If the player character knows at least one spell, it's easy to find out whether a spell color trap effect is active by pressing + to open the spell menu or Z to open the casting menu: instead of "Known spells" or "Choose which spell to cast", the game will say "Your spells are <color>", and the corresponding effect(s) from the list below are in effect.

The various spell color traps are as follows:

^ pink spell trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the pink spell condition that displays as "Your spells became pink" on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, there's a random direction rolled each turn that you simply cannot use, i.e. it's not possible to walk in that direction, and directional attacks, spells etc. also don't accept that direction. If this happens in a corridor and the forbidden direction is the one that you want to use in order to proceed further down the corridor, just wait a turn and the forbidden direction will be re-randomized (with an 1 in 8 chance of rolling the same one again). Additionally, casting a spell will display a random fake message.

^ bright cyan spell trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the bright cyan spell condition that displays as "Your spells became bright cyan" on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, all tiles that have at least one monster adjacent to them but don't contain a monster themselves will be displayed as a bright cyan # glyph regardless of what's really there, and casting a spell will create a random monster somewhere on the level with an increased chance of the monster being out of depth.

^ cyan spell trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the cyan spell condition that displays as "Your spells became cyan" on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, your spells will lose memory over time much more slowly than usual, and casting one successfully will decrease the spell memory instead of increasing it, essentially limiting how often you can cast the spell before you need to use some method to refresh their memory (e.g. reading the spellbook again or, if available, using the reinforce memory technique). To make matters worse, this trap also causes all spells to display as 100% memory in the spellcasting menu regardless of how much memory they really have left, and the usual warning messages when a spell gets low on memory are disabled.

^ black spell trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the black spell condition that displays as "Your spells became black" on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, all spells display 0% failure rate but actually have increased failure rates, ranging from 10% more fail for level 1 spells up to 300% more fail for level 8 ones.

^ orange spell trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the orange spell condition that displays as "Your spells became orange" on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, all tiles that are farther than an euclidean distance of 100 from the player character are obscured by an orange # glyph and casting a spell deals damage equal to the amount of mana the spell costs (but the spell also still costs mana). This can kill you if you try to cast a spell with only little health.

^ red spell trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the red spell condition that displays as "Your spells became red" on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, there is a 1 in 10 chance per turn that the top line displays a garbage string, and every regular messsage on the top line also has a 1 in 10 chance of being replaced with a garbage string (which can result in the player missing an important message), plus casting a spell has a 1 in 3 chance of hitting the player with a cursed unicorn horn effect. The latter can potentially result in becoming deathly sick or losing stats, among other things.

^ platinum spell trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the platinum spell condition that displays as "Your spells became platinum" on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, tiles can randomly look like iron bars, obscuring what is really there, and these fake iron bars are still capable of stopping the player's movement just like real iron bars; it is advisable to refresh the screen with Ctrl-R if the faux iron bars are blocking movement. Also, casting a spell with too little mana will cast it anyway, with no confirmation, and deal damage to the player's HP and maximum HP. You can die from this if you try to cast a spell with only little health.

^ silver spell trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the silver spell condition that displays as "Your spells became silver" on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, spell failure rates are recalculated: if a spell would have exactly 50% failure rate, it has 0% failure rate instead. If it would have 0% failure rate, it has 90% failure rate instead; if it would have between 1% and 49% failure rate, the failure rate is doubled, and if it would have between 51% and 99% failure rate, the failure rate is reduced by (failure rate - 50) * 2%. This basically means that spells that were moderately difficult to cast will become easier, while ones that were already easy to cast become hard to cast and ones that were already very hard to cast will still be very hard to cast. Additionally, if you fail to cast a spell while having this effect active, the entire playing field becomes black, obscuring what is really there until you manage to successfully cast a spell again or get rid of the silver spell trap effect.

^ metal spell trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the metal spell condition that displays as "Your spells became metal" on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, walls will randomly display as either cyan or bright cyan, and all metallic items are inherently rustproof while the effect is active but all non-metallic items can rust. Also, metallic armor pieces will no longer cause spellcasting penalties, but every armor slot that isn't covered with a metallic item will give the amount of spellcasting penalty that an iron piece of equipment would give without this trap effect. Annoyingly, this also applies to slots in which the character is wearing nothing, which includes the shield slot even when dual-wielding or using a two-handed weapon, so unless the character is specifically wearing a metallic shield or playing a role that gets no shield spellcasting penalties, there will be a penalty.

^ green spell trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the green spell condition that displays as "Your spells became green" on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, the entire playing field is displayed in green and casting a spell deletes the current level map, i.e. map amnesia for the current dungeon level forcing the player to re-explore it.

^ blue spell trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the blue spell condition that displays as "Your spells became blue" on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, tiles randomly look like regular room tiles even if something else is there, which can be rather confusing as it can obscure items, monsters or other dungeon features, and casting a spell causes 100 extra points of hunger in addition to the regular amount of hunger caused by spellcasting.

^ completely gray spell trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the completely gray spell condition that displays as "Your spells became completely gray" on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, casting any spell will paralyze the player for one turn.

^ brown spell trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the brown spell condition that displays as "Your spells became brown" on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, there's a 1 in 500 chance that the game tries to make a heap of shit on a random tile (if that picks a square that isn't walkable or already has a trap, nothing happens), and if it successfully makes one, it'll be marked as seen so the player will be able to see it at a distance. Also, certain tiles will display a faux heap of shit. This trap disables the confirmation prompt when walking into a known heap of shit, and the player will trigger them even while flying. Casting a spell while on a tile that doesn't have a trap on it will place a new heap of shit underneath the player.

^ white spell trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the white spell condition that displays as "Your spells became white" on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, casting a spell costs four times the usual amount of mana.

^ violet spell trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the violet spell condition that displays as "Your spells became violet" on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, magenta or bright magenta monsters have +20 spawn frequency, and casting a spell pushes the player one or more squares into a random direction. The latter can potentially be useful in a corridor when there's only one direction in which the character can be pushed (e.g. because the other direction is blocked by a monster), but in open areas, the randomness of both the direction and pushing distance probably make it much less useful.

^ yellow spell trap - Triggering it while not already under its effect causes the yellow spell condition that displays as "Your spells became yellow" on the enlightenment screen. While under the effect, the spellcasting menu tells the player that they have "yellow spells", and actually casting them consumes twice the usual amount of mana. Another nasty effect of this trap is that the main playing screen no longer updates correctly, causing visual artifacts to appear sometimes that makes it difficult to see what is really there and what is not. The farlook function gets fooled by the artifacts, too.
Feminism traps

These are traps that have various female names, and like nasty traps, cause long-lasting ongoing effects when triggered. Curing their effects requires a bitcher, which (like the switcher used for curing nasty trap effects) is an extremely rare tool-class item; alternately their effects need to be waited out. Unlike nasty traps however, these traps do reveal themselves and print a message when triggered, and a different message when their effects end.

^ femmy trap - while active, the game will spawn random fart traps, heel traps and farting monsters over time. The latter are likely to be out of depth. Message when triggering it is "Now, the dungeon will be more feminine for a while!", message when it times out is "The dungeon no longer seems feminine.".

^ madeleine trap - while active, intelligent female monsters with kick attacks have +100 to-hit against the player, which means their attacks are practically guaranteed to hit. This applies to all of their melee attacks, not just the kick attack itself. Message when triggering it is "Your shins can expect to get kicked repeatedly by all the girls and women now!", message when it times out is "Your shins are no longer super sensitive to being kicked by women.".

^ marlena trap - while active, every glyph on the screen has a 10% chance of being displayed in green, regardless of what color it would normally have. Message when triggering it is "Green is the new favorite color, it seems!", message when it times out is "The dungeon is less green now.".

^ anastasia trap - while active, random shit traps spawn over time and the player triggers them even while flying or levitating. Message when triggering it is "Suddenly, you feel that you're going to step into a heap of shit.", message when it times out is "You come back to your senses and realize that stepping into a heap of shit is, well, shit.".

^ jessica trap - while active, the player's constitution is reduced by 5, monsters with lashing attacks have a chance of dealing extra damage to the player, and monsters with touch attacks can cause the player character to fart, which results in random bad effects. Message when triggering it is "Your butt cheeks suddenly feel very tender, and in fact, a similar thing is happening to your entire body!", message when it times out is "You no longer have super tender butt cheeks, or a super tender body for that matter.".

^ solvejg trap - while active, the player is randomly hit with the aggravate monster spell effect, and has +5 charisma as well as intrinsic aggravate monster. Trying to use the chat command can untame pets, turn peaceful monsters hostile, and frenzy hostile monsters. The player cannot have stealth while this trap effect is active. Message when triggering it is "You suddenly have a very grating, aggravating voice, and you start to emit a beguiling odor! In fact, you're super sexy and sweet now!", message when it times out is "At last, your voice is normal again, although you're also considerably less sexy than you used to be.".

^ wendy trap - while active, newly spawned intelligent female monsters have more max HP, and all intelligent female monsters have +d20 melee to-hit against the player while the player's melee to-hit against them is reduced by d20. Message when triggering it is "All the female denizens of the dungeon will show you their true power, and it will happen very soon!", message when it times out is "You survived the wrath of the women, and feel safe from them now.".

^ katharina trap - while active, intelligent female monsters who find a toilet can use it to paralyze the player from infinitely far away, and their farting distance is also greatly increased (normally it requires them to be adjacent). Message when triggering it is "You feel that the girls and women are getting ready to use their sexy butts as weapons.", message when it times out is "The female dungeon inhabitants decide to make their butts Geneva-compliant again.".

^ elena trap - while active, monsters using high heel attacks or farting attacks against the player have a chance of using them several times in a single turn, making them potentially much more dangerous. Message when triggering it is "You long for beautiful sexy women with tender butt cheeks and lovely high heels.", message when it times out is "Your lust for pretty women fades. Aww...".

^ thai trap - while active, walking over a toilet while not hungry causes the player to take a shit, which reduces nutrition and can cure food poisoning (if present) but reduces the character's alignment record by 20. The player's strength and dexterity are reduced by 2, and all monsters can use toilets to paralyze the player. Message when triggering it is "You feel that you'll want to use the toilet more often. Also, somehow your physique seems weaker now...", message when it times out is "You no longer need to constantly go to the toilet, and also your physique seems normal now.".

^ elif trap - while active, the player is repeatedly hit by a random effect chosen from the following four possibilities: lose some HP and drop the currently wielded weapon (unless it's cursed); random bad effect; -1 maximum hit point; +1 maximum hit point. The net loss/gain of maximum HP averages out to zero, so this trap cannot be used to gain excessive amounts of maximum HP. Message when triggering it is "A ghostly girl (named Elif) starts following you around, and apparently she wants to play with you!", message when it times out is "The lovely ghostly girl named Elif disappears, telling you that she enjoyed the time she spent with you.".

^ nadja trap - while active, trying to attack an intelligent female monster causes the player to take damage, even if the attack missed. The average amount of damage done by this effect increases the more often it's triggered, and times out very slowly over time. Message when triggering it is "You feel that you angered the womanhood. If you now hit a woman, you will be hit with retribution!", message when it times out is "The women are no longer angry at you, and you may hit them again. Don't get it wrong though - I didn't say that you *should*, just that you're no longer hit with retribution if you do - they will still fight back!".

^ sandra trap - while active, intelligent female monsters who have kick attacks can always attack the player with winter stilettos in melee, even if they're not actually wearing any, which deals more damage the more often it hits; the variable for this type of damage times out very slowly over time. Message when triggering it is "You just know that your legs are going to be ripped open by very sharp-edged combat boot heels.", message when it times out is "Somehow, you're still alive. Your legs are now safe from any imaginary winter stilettos.".

^ natalje trap - while active, the player has intrinsic sleep resistance and free action, +10 charisma and the ability to paralyze enemies for one turn by kicking them, but must move to a different square once every 7 turns. Failure to do so will reduce charisma by one, or if the player's charisma is already at the minimum, reduce both current maximum HP by five, which can kill a low-HP player character. Also, regardless of whether the player had enough charisma or not when they failed to move to a different square in time, their inventory items are randomly damaged. It should be noted that if the player is paralyzed or otherwise unable to move, the timer keeps running anyway, potentially resulting in the player losing charisma and suffering item damage with no way to prevent it. However, multi-turn occupations are interrupted if the player has only a few turns left to shuffle their position. Message when triggering it is "You gotta dance! You've suddenly become super sexy and attractive, and neither sleep nor paralysis can stop you in your tracks. And you can kick your enemies to stomp their toes flat. But if you ever stand still for too long, a bunch of bloodthirsty female painted toenails is going to hurt your beautiful skin, so make sure you keep moving!", message when it times out is "After dancing for a long time, you are exhausted. And thus, at last you may rest again. But your sexiness and all the other benefits fade.".

^ jeanetta trap - while active, intelligent female monsters with kick attacks will deal extra damage when their kick hits, with the average amount of this extra damage increasing every time it hits. Message when triggering it is "Lots of shreds of skin will be scraped off your shins, and the girls will enjoy it.", message when it times out is "Jeanetta is done collecting your skin shreds. Better don't visit her trophy hall unless you got a strong stomach.".

^ yvonne trap - while active, floor tiles may randomly turn into toilets over time, and walking over one while not hungry will cause the player to take a shit. This results in paralysis for a while; normally 5 turns, and if the player is wearing armor or a cloak, the duration of taking off those items is added to the duration (but they're not actually unequipped). As a result of using the toilet, the player loses some nutrition and may have their food poisoning cured (if present). Message when triggering it is "You feel that people are building toilets for you to use.", message when it times out is "There are no more toilets being built specifically for you.".

^ maurah trap - while active, the player has to fart every once in a while, which results in a random bad effect. Message when triggering it is "Your sexy butt signals that it wants to produce beautiful farting noises!", message when it times out is "Your butt is no longer as sexy as before, and will no longer fart unless you tell it to do so.".

^ meltem trap - while active, all intelligent female monsters can use farting attacks against the player. Message when triggering it is "All the girls want to use their sexy butt cheeks as weapons now!", message when it times out is "The girls exhausted their farting gas.".

^ sarah trap - while active, there's a chance each turn that a stinking gas cloud forms somewhere on the current dungeon level, with the message "You hear tender air current noises." These clouds can anger peaceful monsters, and if they kill a pet or always peaceful human, it counts as the player killing the monster, with the usual penalties. Message when triggering it is "You can already imagine the farting noises you're gonna hear.", message when it times out is "Apparently the farting gas is depleted.".

^ claudia trap - while active, the player has intrinsic confusion resistance and tiles may randomly turn into clouds, with a chance of spawning certain high-level monsters on those cloud tiles. Also, every once in a while the player will become heavily confused for d20 turns. Message when triggering it is "Suddenly you feel a little confused, and also feel like stroking the sexy butt cheeks of a woman in wooden sandals.", message when it times out is "Your sexy butt cheek wood confusion ends.".

^ ludgera trap - while active, monsters with loud farting attacks will randomly spawn over time. Message when triggering it is "You'll certainly like to listen to the disgusting toilet noises.", message when it times out is "At last the disgusting toilet noises ceased.".

^ kati trap - while active, intelligent female monsters with kick attacks will deal extra damage to the player, and have a small chance of asking the player to clean their shoes. Answering "no" does nothing, while answering "yes" causes the character to be busy for 200 turns and turns the monster peaceful. If the player is interrupted during that time, a yes/no prompt is given whether the player wants to abort their activity; actually aborting it turns all non-tame monsters on the current dungeon level hostile. However, while the player is busy, monsters will usually walk away instead of towards the character, making it more likely to finish the activity without being disturbed. Message when triggering it is "You feel like being kicked by sexy girls and cleaning their shoes.", message when it times out is "You vow to never clean a girl's shoes again.".

^ nelly trap - while active, intelligent female monsters have a ranged damage-dealing hug attack in addition to their other attacks that they can use against the player. Message when triggering it is "You fear that the women are going to crush you with a hug.", message when it times out is "Good thing you survived the dangerous female hug attacks.".

^ eveline trap - while active, intelligent female monsters move at 1.5 times their regular speed. This applies to peaceful and tame ones too, and can therefore be useful in theory if the player has a pet that qualifies. Message when triggering it is "It seems that the women are running faster.", message when it times out is "Apparently the women stopped running.".

^ karin trap - while active, intelligent female monsters with kick attacks can kick the player in the nuts even if the player doesn't have any, and potentially do so several times in the same turn, or occasionally also heal the player, but more often than not, the amount of damage is higher than the amount healed. Message when triggering it is "All the women want to knee you in the delicate nuts now!", message when it times out is "Your nuts no longer have to fear getting kicked by female knees constantly.".

^ juen trap - while active, the player has extrinsic free action, and intelligent female monsters with kick attacks have a chance of paralyzing the player with a kick. This particular paralysis ignores free action and has a chance of being applied even while the player is already paralyzed, potentially resulting in chain paralysis. Message when triggering it is "Oh no, your shins are almost broken!", message when it times out is "You finally took a trick from your emergency bag of tricks to heal your almost broken shins.".

^ kristina trap - while active, intelligent female monsters can use burn attacks against the player in melee in addition to their other attacks. Message when triggering it is "Urgh, you can already smell the stench of stinking cigarettes!", message when it times out is "Finally the damn cigarettes got extinguished.".

^ lou trap - while active, monsters with kick attacks have a chance of randomly withering the player's inventory items when their kick hits. This erodes the affected items, even if they're erosionproof, and can result in thoroughly eroded items being destroyed. Message when triggering it is "These damn people want to use your precious clothing to brush off their dirty shoes!", message when it times out is "You swear that you'll kill the next asshole who brushes your cloak with their dirty shoes.".

^ almut trap - while active, intelligent female monsters have an additional melee attack that causes the player to drop their weapon, unless it's cursed. Message when triggering it is "The girls feel like kicking your hands bloodily with their sneakers!", message when it times out is "Apparently you managed to save yourself from the bloodthirsty girl turn shoes.".

^ julietta trap - while active, the player may randomly be affected with other feminism trap effects that will last for a while. A message is given if this causes a new trap effect to activate. Message when triggering it is "Now you'll be subjected to Julietta's torture, and she'll subject you to random punishments from time to time.", message when it times out is "It seems that Julietta finally got bored and decides to annoy other people instead of you.".

^ arabella trap - while active, random traps will spawn over time on the current dungeon level, including in wall tiles, and they have a greatly increased chance of being nasty traps. Message when triggering it is "Oh no, the master of nasty traps is laying out her snares to get you!", message when it times out is "You're relieved to have gotten over the nastiness. Beware, there may still be some traps around.".

^ kristin trap - while active, intelligent female monsters can use random high heel attacks against the player in melee, regardless of what footwear (if any) they're actually wearing. Message when triggering it is "You feel that there are women around who really like various high heels.", message when it times out is "The women got bored of the multitude of high heels.".

^ anna trap - while active, perfume monsters have +50 spawn frequency, and the player will trigger shit traps even while flying or levitating. Message when triggering it is "Oh, it seems that the hussies are on the loose!", message when it times out is "There's an announcement saying that the hussies no longer consider you a target. Phew.".

^ ruea trap - while active, random monsters that use conversion sermon will spawn over time. Message when triggering it is "You get the feeling that some women are trying to convert you.", message when it times out is "The women gave up their attempts to convert you.".

^ dora trap - while active, monsters with claw attacks spawn more often and may damage the player's worn boots (no special effect if none are worn). This can result in the boots being destroyed if the attack hits often enough, and if the player's shoes are high-heeled, the odds of them being damaged by this effect are much higher. If it actually succeeds in destroying the player's high heels, the character will go berserk, increasing the player's melee damage output for a while but resulting in heavy confusion and stun when the berserk timer ends. Message when triggering it is "Ack! There's birds on the loose, and they want to eat your shoes!", message when it times out is "There's a loud flapping noise indicating that the evil shoe-hating birds are leaving the dungeon.".

^ marike trap - while active, monsters with squeaky farting attacks have +10 spawn frequency, and hostile farting monsters of all types will lifesave with 80% chance when they're killed. Message when triggering it is "You want to endlessly listen to squeaking farting noises.", message when it times out is "Aww, apparently you no longer want to listen to squeaking farting noises. But why? You didn't even come yet...".

^ jette trap - while active, random feminism traps spawn much more often. Message when triggering it is "The power of feminism compels you.", message when it times out is "The power of feminism seems to be decreasing. Don't feel safe just yet, though.".

^ ina trap - while active, the player character has anorexia and -3 strength and constitution. Dying while having a temporary ina trap effect active will cure it, which helps only if the player is able to lifesave, but the game remembers how long the trap effect would have continued, and if the player vomits for any reason while the timer hasn't run out yet, the ina trap effect immediately becomes active again with an even longer timeout. Message when triggering it is "Oh my god, you are now afflicted with the life-threatening disease known as anorexia!", message when it times out is "Since you didn't vomit for a week, your anorexia condition disappears. But here's a newsflash: you could have instantly healed the condition by simply dying (don't try that at home).".

^ sing trap - while active, random shoe monsters will spawn over time, and those particular shoe monsters will ask the player to clean them when they're in melee range. This results in a yes/no prompt; if the player refuses by saying "no", it results in 5 turns of paralysis (which ignores free action), turns all peaceful monsters on the level hostile and frenzies them. However, saying "yes" will turn the shoe monster peaceful and set a long-lasting occupation; if the player is interrupted during that time, a yes/no prompt is given whether the player wants to abort their activity, and actually aborting it turns all non-tame monsters on the current dungeon level hostile. However, while the player is busy, monsters will usually walk away instead of towards the character, making it more likely to finish the activity without being disturbed. Message when triggering it is "A heinously evil woman plans to force you to clean the shit from all kinds of female shoes...", message when it times out is "You got enough and decide to end the evil woman's slavery reign by bashing her face with a platform boot that has cow dung on the soles. After striking her down, you flee from your prison and don't look back.".

^ victoria trap - while active, female monsters with kick attacks have +20 spawn frequency, and such monsters may also randomly spawn over time in addition to the regular random generation. Message when triggering it is "There's some karate women who want to demonstrate their combat capabilities to you.", message when it times out is "You finished playing with the karate women.".

^ melissa trap - while active, intelligent female monsters have item-stealing melee attacks that they can use against the player in addition to their regular attacks. If the monster is of a species that is always female, this theft attack has an increased chance of actually stealing something. Message when triggering it is "You suddenly feel that the women in this dungeon are quite attractive...", message when it times out is "It dawns on you that being seduced by women isn't a good thing, because they might steal your stuff.".

^ anita trap - while active, intelligent female monsters have a bleeding-inducing melee attack that they can use against the player in addition to their regular attacks. Message when triggering it is "The women want to slit your legs with razor-sharp high heels! Be afraid of them!", message when it times out is "You survived the dangerous high heels... for now.".

^ henrietta trap - while active, moving around has a small chance of creating a shit trap underneath the player if there is no trap underneath the location the player moved to, and the newly created trap immediately triggers. Also, regardless of whether the trap was generated or not, the player will also fumble, losing a turn. While this trap effect is active, the player triggers shit traps even while flying or levitating. Message when triggering it is "You feel that someone is going to open the zippers of your boots, making you fumble into a heap of dog shit.", message when it times out is "At last, you wised up and decided to switch to a pair of boots without zippers.".

^ verena trap - while active, the player may randomly be affected by one of the following five effects every once in a while as long as their current HP is at least half of the maximum amount: take massive melee damage; be confused for a while; be paralyzed for up to 10 turns (ignores free action); be blinded for a while; take bleeding damage for a while. Each of this events also deals physical damage, with the first result dealing five times as much as the others. However, if the player character has less than 20% of their health left, there's a random chance that the player is healed up a bit. Message when triggering it is "Oh no, some annoying blonde girl starts to follow you around. Sigh. Why can't you get a clever companion instead?!", message when it times out is "Now you're so annoyed that you slap that annoying blonde girl right in the face, knocking her out. Maybe now she'll leave you alone, she already caused enough annoyance anyway.".
Other traps

^ s-pressing trap - doesn't spawn randomly, and is created only if the player uses the s-pressing technique. This trap doesn't affect the player, but a hostile monster that steps into it may take damage and potentially be killed. Only monsters that didn't see the player laying the trap can trigger it, and then only if they cannot see the player at the time of triggering it; if a monster does trigger it and is affected, this trap is removed, i.e. it only triggers once.
