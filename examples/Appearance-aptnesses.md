The appearance aptness was introduced in version v170 of [[Slash'EM Extended]] or there-abouts, and means that certain types of armor with randomized appearances will have special attributes. Such attributes can be good or bad, and may influence the player's decisions when building their ascension kit. In almost all cases the randomized appearance of items will only have their special effect if the player is actually wearing them, meaning that monsters wearing them don't get their effects.

* polyform cloak: Grants a very low chance of a controlled polymorph every turn.

* musical helmet: If the player uses an instrument that has charges, the devices skill is trained a lot faster than it normally would.

* netradiation helmet: Slowly saps the player's maximum health, and offers partial protection from gaze attacks.
* orange visored helmet: Protects from [[blindness]] attacks.

If any potions or other fragile items are hit by the iron objects, they will break and potentially subject the player to their vapors.
