This page lists the various egotypes that monsters and items can have in [[Slash'EM Extended]], including descriptions of what they do.

== Monster Egotypes ==

Every [[monster]] can be created with egotypes, in which case it will be highlighted yellow. Monsters can also gain egotypes via the wand or potion of mutation, and lose them by getting cancelled.

It is theoretically possible for monsters to have dozens of egotypes, which will all be in effect simultaneously. Also, occasionally the monster will not have the egotypes added to its name, which means they are hidden; a yellow-highlighted monster that doesn't show egotype names doesn't lack egotypes, so beware!

== Item Egotypes ==

Only [[armor]]s (including [[gloves]], [[boots]], [[helmet]]s, [[shield]]s, [[cloak]]s and [[shirt]]s) can currently have an egotype, and every item can only have one egotype. They can be generated with them, or occasionally an item will gain a random egotype by a [[scroll of enchant armor]].

Unidentified armors with egotypes display as "an enchanted [[foo]]". In order to determine the nature of the enchantment, the player can either [[identify]] the item or wear it. Beware: Not all egotypes are beneficial, and the armor might be cursed, so wear-testing them is not always a good idea.

Wear an egotype armor in order to get the enchantment's effect. Currently, monsters do not gain any special effects from these.
