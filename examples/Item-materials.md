This page lists the various item materials in [[SLASH'EM Extended]]. Some of them can [[rust]], [[corrode]], [[burn]] or [[rot]], and certain materials are subject to specific erosion types only if the game  is played in [[Evil Variant|evilvariant mode]]. 

Players can change the base material of an item by using a material kit, which will affect all instances of that base item. Example: using a glass material kit on a dagger means that from now on all "dagger" items will be made of glass (including ones that were generated before the kit was used), but e.g. "orcish dagger" or "elven dagger" will be unaffected since they're different base items.

Turning on the "materialglyph" option will show abbreviations for items' materials in inventory and also in some messages.

== Material-changing scrolls ==
There are scrolls of inferior, regular and superior material, which can be used to change the material of a base item to another randomized type. Doing this will notably affect all copies of the item in question, both ones that exist at that time and all that get generated in future, for that current game. So if the player e.g. turns a dagger (which is made of iron by default) into one made of chrome, then all daggers are made of chrome, but orcish, elven etc. daggers won't be affected because they're a different base item.

The list of possible materials are as follows:

inferior: liquid wax veggy flesh paper cloth leather iron plastic tar secree pourpoor sand ceramic foam scrap alloy

regular: mysterious wood bone metal copper glass gemstone mineral silk compost brick shadowstuff obsidian lead chrome

superior: dragonhide silver gold platinum mithril viva inka arcanium eternium ether nanomachine celestium conundrum pwn-bubble meteosteel antidotium

Every material in the respective list for a scroll has the same chance of being picked. If the player is trying to get a specific material, the material kit item will be more useful (but is also very rare), alternately having a good supply of the respective type of scroll (and maybe a magic marker to write more of them) may be necessary along with some favorable RNG.
