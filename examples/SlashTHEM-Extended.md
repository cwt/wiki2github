SlashTHEM Extended is the unofficial "variant inside a variant" that can be played in Slash'EM Extended. It can be accessed by either picking the soviet race (either as main or hybrid race), or adding the following options line to the configuration file:

OPTIONS=hybridsoviet

In this mode, many aspects of the game behave as if it were SlashTHEM, but with the difference that all the Slash'EM Extended monsters, items, traps etc. are still in the game. It also renames all item names to Russian, which can make the game rather confusing; using the in-game item description function (by hitting an item's corresponding letter while in the inventory screen) will help, and the player can also #name items and give them their original English name. Certain actions will also give Russian messages, either in addition to the standard ones or replacing them. A loose, probably incomplete list of effects by playing in "soviet mode" can be seen below.

The "group spawn system" that will occasionally spawn random monster groups on the current dungeon level is deactivated.
Nasty item seedings, where the current dungeon level is filled with evil musable items that the monsters can use against you, are deactivated.
Having a high riding skill does not improve the player character's HP regeneration rate, but reduces it instead (whoops!)
The player character does not get any of the extra bonuses to Pw regeneration.
Whenever the player saves and loads, the timers for when monster spawn frequency starts increasing or reaches its maximum are re-initialized. This is a bug.
Applying a stethoscope at an egg often returns the wrong monster name (ooooops).
Blessed stethoscopes don't reveal any extra information compared to uncursed ones.
The player once again always moves randomly when stunned, and 1 in 2 moves instead of 1 in 8 moves when confused.
Unicorn horns are more likely to work, will not permanently reduce attribute points and have a 1 in 3 chance of causing a bad effect when applied.
The chemistry set never works if the player does not know the chemistry spell, as opposed to having a 33% chance of working anyway.
Wands of deslexification can be generated. Zapping them at certain monsters will cancel, disintegrate or delete them (randomly selected). Monsters can also zap them at the player to do damage, and zapping yourself is an instadeath. Engrave message is "The bugs on the floor seem unaffected."
Role-specific sacrifice gifts are more likely to be given by the gods.
Artifact blast damage does not scale down if the player is low-level, meaning that picking up a crossaligned artifact at XL1 is once again a very bad idea.
Weapons that can bash down iron bars will only rarely succeed in doing so.
Wands of digging can only dig out a single tile per zap on a maze level.
Dropping an item on an altar for BUC testing can occasionally cause a bad effect, but it cannot cause the altar to disappear.
Rings dropped down a sink only have a minuscule chance of not being consumed.
Dropping or picking up items once again takes a turn.
Corpses that go moldy will always turn into a F-class monster, the chance of getting a b, j or P has been removed.
Genocided and unique monsters cannot appear as hallucinatory monster names.
The starting pet can only ever be a little dog or kitten, no matter what role is chosen.
Pets that were left on another dungeon level will go feral at the vanilla rate, which is about 7 times faster than the one used in Slash'EM Extended.
Pets will once again eat corpses of other pets as well as zero nutrition corpses.
Covetous monsters, humans and demons are once again completely impossible to tame by normal means.
Player characters and pets eating corpses will once again take forever to chow down the food.
Pets can once again pick up non-empty containers.
The player's steed is once again highly likely to throw the player off under conflict.
Pets will once again attack shopkeepers and temple priests.
Monsters that require a +x weapon to be hit are completely impossible to hit with weapons that have too little enchantment.
Trees will always bear fruit that can be harvested by kicking.
Gems thrown to unicorns once again have the old, higher chance of affecting the player's luck, and will not be removed from the game.
The dungeon will always have every special level, instead of having a certain percentage chance for each of them to exist.
Level difficulty will get arbitrarily reduced less often, resulting in more difficult monster spawns.
Rotten food cannot cause sliming.
The odds of getting intrinsics from corpses are reverted to the much higher vanilla odds, including telepathy being guaranteed.
Newt corpses have the chance of granting extra mana reduced by a factor 3.
Rotten, tainted etc. tins don't make the player more hungry when eaten (although the resulting vomiting still does).
Blessed food is not immune to being rotten, but has the same odds as uncursed food, and the general odds of food being rotten are much higher.
The player does not get less nutrition from eating food when already satiated, and also no extra nutrition from eating when hungry.
"Do not pass go" is only shown when dying on the very first turn. Dying on the second turn gives a different unique message instead.
Scrolls of scare monster are much less likely to randomly burn up.
The old experience point formula, where the first level up takes forever for no apparent reason, is back in place.
Being hit by a level-draining attack will always take off an experience level, as opposed to only taking off a fraction of the current level's experience.
Leveling up does not refill the player's HP to full.
Fire, cold and shock are much more likely to destroy certain items in the player's inventory.
Water demons summoned from fountains once again have a depth-based chance of granting a wish, rather than having a fixed 3% chance.

Entering a special room does not wake up monsters.
Full-inventory identify does not try to identify items inside the player's containers.
The mechanic that causes big stacks of items to resist manipulation does not exist.
Artifact keys can open non-artifact doors.
Monsters with ranged weapons don't get extra ammo beyond their usual amount.
Monsters that can hide under objects will not spawn with objects to hide under.
Egotype monsters have a sizable chance of not displaying what egotype they have, and also a good chance of not displaying that they have any egotypes at all.
Monsters which are supposed to be uncommon are less uncommon. Since these are usually dangerous monsters, this increases the general difficulty of the game.
Monsters whose levels are too low will not spawn if the monster difficulty is high.
Monsters will always spawn hostile, including the quest leader. A few exceptions exist.
Messages about things happening outside the player's line of sight, including monsters using ranged weapons, breath attacks or spells, will not appear.

The weaken and paralyze monster spells are once again as powerful as they were in vanilla.
The web attack used by some monsters is four times more likely to generate a random trap on the current dungeon level.

Weapons and armors don't get dull when used often.
Monsters engulfing the player never miss.
Amnesia will erase much more of the player's knowledge per incident.

Damage reduction will start at -20 player AC rather than 0, and is generally weaker.
Most monster-versus-player gaze attacks will always trigger, rather than having a certain percentage chance per attempt.
There is no level-based reduction of the damage the player takes.
A graphical line of dialogue was removed from foocubus seduction attacks, sadly. This causes the rest of the messages to appear out of context.

Gehennom does not have random rooms-and-corridors levels.
Many special rooms have a higher value for the minimum depth at which they can spawn.
Items hidden in walls will not appear on special levels.
Non-vanilla traps appear less often in general.
Random altars will not be unaligned.
Items that can generate in stacks will not have a chance to get extra stack size.
Rocks and gems, as well as iron balls and chains always generate with an enchantment of +0, although that doesn't prevent the player from enchanting them.
Wands will not spawn empty or cancelled.
Tree fruits have no chance of being "rare" kinds of fruit.
Monsters in special rooms start out awake.
Hostile eels are horribly weak on land again.
Killing a monster that is engulfing the player, or killing a monster that is in a wall, prevents it from leaving a death drop.
Monsters that don't leave a corpse or have no hands cannot leave a death drop. Kops cannot leave death drops either.
Monsters don't have a chance of randomly not using musable items per turn. Mindless monsters and animals cannot use such items at all, defensive items also cannot be used by exploders, ghosts and kops, and offensive items cannot be used by monsters that lack hands.
If an artifact wish fails, you don't get a random artifact as a consolation prize.

The spellcasting menu does not tell the player how much spell memory they have left.
All spells have a 30% extra chance of failure that can only be gotten rid of by training the relevant spellcasting skill/stat, and all spells can have 100% failure rate if the player's skills and stats are bad enough.
If the player character starts with several copies of the same spellbook, the extras don't add to the player's starting spellcasting memory.
The restrictions that prohibit saddling and riding certain creatures are back.
The power surge technique has a shorter timeout.
Water is considered a safe teleport location as long as you can swim.
Grease does not protect from certain types of erosion.
Statue traps don't get generated hidden underneath items or monsters.
