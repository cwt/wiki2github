Techniques originated in [[SLASH'EM]] but have been expanded in [[Slash'EM Extended]]. Many additional techniques were added and attempts were made to better integrate them into the game. Using a technique can now train the corresponding "techniques" skill if the player character has it, and with higher skill the average timeout of techniques is lower so they can be used more often. When a technique becomes available again, the player now gets a message telling them about it. Also, every character starts with at least a few basic techniques and can learn specific ones by enhancing the right skills. Other than that, the techniques learned upon leveling up depend on the chosen role and race. Some characters may learn random techniques from leveling up, and artifacts exist that allow the player to learn additional ones.

This page tries to list the various techniques that exist in the game with explanations on what they do.


* berserk: Increases the damage done by the player's attacks for a period of time.
* kiii: Increases the damage done by the player's attacks for a period of time.
* research: Allows the player to identify items from their pack, with the chance of success depending on the sum of intelligence and wisdom.
* surgery: If carrying a scalpel, allows the player to cure sickness or sliming, losing 5 HP (thankfully not max HP) in the process. Otherwise, it heals some lost hit points; if carrying a medical kit that has at least one bandage in it, the amount healed is much higher.
* reinforce memory: Requires the player to have an almost forgotten spell (less than 10% spell memory left but more than 0%), and adds 100% spell memory to it. Make sure to pay attention to messages telling you that you're about to forget a spell.
* missile flurry: Allows the character to temporarily fire many more projectiles than usual from a bow, crossbow or sling. It only lasts for a short time, so it's best to already have the launcher equipped when using this.
* weapon practice: The player practices with the wielded weapon, which trains the corresponding skill by a rather large amount and can also sometimes reveal the weapon's enchantment value. However, it lasts about 10 turns and can be interrupted, aborting the technique and putting it on timeout without actually training anything, so it's best to use it while there are no monsters around.
* eviscerate: Requires the player to be bare-handed and not polymorphed, and temporarily increases the damage done with unarmed attacks.
* healing hands: Using it cures sickness or sliming, or if not suffering from those effects it heals some lost hit points.
* calm steed: Requires the player to be riding, and increases the steed's tameness.
* turn undead: See [[Turn undead]].
* vanish: Temporarily makes the player very fast and invisible.
* cutthroat: Requires a bladed weapon to be in the player's main hand, and allows a very powerful attack on an adjacent monster. If that monster has a head, there's a chance to instakill it.
* blessing: The player can select an item in open inventory, which will go from cursed to uncursed, or from uncursed to blessed. SLEX's usual rules for manipulating stacks apply, so using this on a stack of 3 uncursed scrolls of enchant weapon for example only has a 1 in 3 chance of success.
* elemental fist: The player's unarmed attacks deal additional elemental damage for a while.
* primal roar: Ups all of the player's pets to their next grown-up form, but only temporarily.
* liquid leap: Allows the player to leap through iron bars or monsters. Passing through a monster that way will deal acid damage to it.
* critical strike: The player performs an extra-powerful attack against an adjacent monster. If that monster is humanoid, the effect will be strong, otherwise you will be "hampered by the differences in anatomy" and do less extra damage.
* sigil of control: Allows the player to control ray spells' rebounds for a while, but costs some mana to use.
* sigil of tempest: Allows the player's ray spells to create 3x3 explosions for a while, but costs some mana to use. The explosions can be controlled if sigil of control is in effect at the same time.
* sigil of discharge: Allows the player's ray spells to work like vanilla NetHack's skilled fireball/cone of cold for a while, but costs some mana to use.
* raise zombies: Has to be used while the player is adjacent to some corpses, which will be resurrected as tame zombies. You have to stand next to the corpses, not on them. To maximize the effect, have a corpse on each of the 8 adjacent squares.
* revivification: Costs some health, but allows the player to revive a dead monster. The monster can then be tamed if it fails a resistance check; minotaur corpses are probably a good target since they have zero MR.
* ward against flame: Gives temporary fire resistance.
* ward against ice: Gives temporary cold resistance.
* ward against lightning: Gives temporary shock resistance.
* tinker: The player tries to upgrade the currently wielded object, but it takes a long while and can be interrupted. One possible use is to try to transform an elven cloak into a cloak of magic resistance. [[Upgrading objects]] has more info.
* rage eruption: The player's hit points are increased to a very high value for a while, but it will slowly bleed off to the original maximum.
* blink: Slows down the flow of time for a few turns, allowing the player to act faster in relation to the monsters.
* chi strike: Used for martial arts, and enhances the player's unarmed strikes with mana for a while. It ends if the player performs a melee attack while having no mana left.
* draw energy: Tries to draw energy (=Pw) from surrounding tiles for a while; standing next to thrones or altars gives the biggest boost, but it can be interrupted by monsters.
* chi healing: By using this, the player will temporarily heal HP rapidly but lose mana every turn. It ends if there is no mana left.
* disarm: Learned by reaching skilled in a weapon, and requires the player to be wielding a weapon that is at least skilled. Then the player can try to disarm an adjacent foe, which can either knock their weapon away or destroy it outright.
* dazzle: The player fires a beam that can paralyze the first monster it hits, but higher-level monsters often resist.
* chained blitz: Allows the player to use several martial arts-related techniques in a single turn, by entering a sequence of keys. The first move can be either a starter or a chain move, the last move can be a finisher or a chain move, and all the moves in between have to be chain moves. Maximum amount of moves that can be used at once is techlevel/5 rounded down.
* pummel: Allows a bare-handed player character to strike several times in a single turn. Unlike SLASH'EM, this can be used while polymorphed in SLEX, where it's absurdly powerful because the player will get several hits with all of their polymorphed form's melee attacks, so e.g. a marilith can get up to 6*4=24 strikes per turn for massive damage. Combining this with chained blitz may allow the player to one-shot [[Demogorgon]].
* ground slam: Martial arts technique that slams the adjacent target into the ground, creating a crater (pit).
* air dash: The player moves several squares in a single turn, but it has to be in a straight line.
* power surge: The player's Pw is set to a very large amount, but slowly bleeds off to the original value. If the player's actual Pw is zero while it's still bleeding off, it harmlessly reduces the maximum Pw to the original maximum, so it can be a good strategy to cast as many spells as possible during the bleedoff period.
* spirit bomb: Martial arts technique that causes an explosion, the damage of which depends on the player's current Pw. This explosion CAN damage pets, contrary to what the spirit bomb article says, so be careful.
* draw blood: Mainly useful for vampires, this technique requires a medical kit with vials and fills one such vial to produce a potion of vampire blood. Unlike regular SLASH'EM, this doesn't always drain an experience level, but sometimes it does.
* world fall: All non-boss monsters on the current dungeon level whose experience level isn't higher than the technique's level are killed. This includes pets, but the player doesn't get a penalty for murdering a pet if one is killed by using this technique. Higher-level monsters need to pass a resistance check or be killed as well.
* create ammo: Creates bullets. If the player is a Doom Marine, it can also make shotgun shells, blaster bolts, rockets or BFG ammo, but all non-bullet ammos have level requirements.
* poke ball: The player tries to tame an adjacent monster. If the monster is a pokemon, the chance of success is increased, and if the monster has the "petty" attribute, success is guaranteed. Unlike actual Pokemon games, reducing the monster's health does not help.
* attire charm: The player has to wear high heels to use this technique, and it will tame an adjacent intelligent humanoid monster that is not a boss or otherwise untameable.
* summon team ant: Summons a couple random tame a-class monsters.
* appraisal: Reveals the wielded weapon's enchantment value. It can also be used on a piece of armor, wand etc., but if the appraised item is not a weapon/ammo/gem/iron ball/chain, the timeout will be much longer.
* egg bomb: Creates a stale cockatrice egg. Careful, picking it up without wearing gloves or having petrification resistance will turn you to stone. Trying to throw it without having one of those properties can give the same result.
* booze: Gives an effect equivalent to quaffing an uncursed potion of booze, and also creates additional potions of booze on the ground. Very important for the clockwork automaton race as a way to gain nutrition.
* invoke deity: A weaker form of praying; if successful, it can restore some of the player's HP. However, if the player's alignment record is negative or you are in Gehennom, you lose health instead and can even be killed.
* double trouble: Rodneyan race signature ability, creates a tame clone of you. Sometimes it also summons a few tame familiars (which are random monsters).
* phase door: A weaker form of self-teleportation, with the same restriction of being useless on no-teleport levels.
* secure identify: The player may pick an item from open inventory, which is guaranteed to be identified without a chance of resisting. If the player has defeated the Motherfucker Glass Golem in the Illusory Castle, this technique's timeout is reduced so it can be used much more frequently.
* iron skin: Temporarily boosts the player's armor class.
* polyform: Polymorphs the player into a completely random monster. This polymorph can't be controlled even if the player has polymorph control, so it's advisable to take off cloaks, shirts and body armor first to avoid the risk of them being destroyed.
* concentrating: Greatly boosts the player's to-hit in melee for a while. Useful for taking down those pesky -40 AC ubermonsters.
* summon pet: Creates a random tame monster.
* double thrownage: The player can throw more darts, spears, daggers, knives, shuriken etc. per turn for a while.
* shield bash: Requires the player to have a shield, and uses it to boost melee attack damage for a while. Higher enchantment on the shield adds more bonus damage.
* recharge: Replicates the uncursed charging effect. Don't use it on your wand of wishing unless you absolutely can't get a blessed scroll of charging.
* spirituality check: Tells the player whether it's safe to pray, and gives the reason(s) if it's not.
* eddy wind: Allows the player to displace monsters for a while. It also increases damage done when dual-wielding, but that requires the player to use the F command to "force-attack" monsters.
* blood ritual: The player needs to have an athame for this technique to work, and it greatly reduces max HP/Pw and drains some stats, but the player may get a wish, acquirement, random artifact or random useful item.
* ent's potion: Restores hit points and fixes standard status effects like confusion or stun, but not life-threatening ones like sickness or stoning.
* lucky gamble: The player's luck either increases or decreases by one point, with 50% chance of either result.
* panic digging: In situations where there is no other way forward, you can use this technique to transform walls on the eight squares surrounding you into open floor. Of course it only works if those squares are diggable, and it also paralyzes you for up to 20 turns, so be careful about using it when monsters are around!
* decontaminate: Greatly reduces your contamination when used.
* wonderspell: Teaches a random spell when used.
* reset technique: Allows you to select a technique that's currently on timeout, which will become usable again.
* silent ocean: Using this technique will try to cancel all ; and I monsters in a rather large area around you. Also, while the technique is active, you have swimming and magical breathing, plus your items are protected from water damage and drowning attacks cannot harm you. If the technique is about to run out, you get a message so you can get out of the water. However, you also cannot cast spells or chat while it's active.
* glowhorn: If you use this technique, you will get the effect of applying a noncursed unicorn horn every turn for a period of time, even if you don't actually have a unicorn horn.
* intrinsic roulette: This technique can give or remove a random intrinsic, which can be good or bad.
* spectral sword: Adds elemental damage to your melee weapon for a period of time.
* reverse identify: Allows you to identify an item based on random appearance, or input the name of an unknown item which will then be identified. It can also randomly identify some other unknown items.
* detect traps: Reveals some of the traps on the current dungeon level when used.
* directive: Very useful for petmasters, this technique lets you give orders to your pets. The higher your petkeeping skill, the more things you can change about your pets' behavior.
* remove implant: Allows you to take off a worn implant, even if it's a cursed one.
* reroll implant: This technique targets a worn implant and will reroll its base stats.
* time stop: Using this technique stops time for 6-11 turns.
* stat resist: Provides temporary resistance to sickness, stun, confusion, blindness, hallucination and fear.
* swap weapon: Allows you to set a different secondary weapon, but only if you're not currently dual-wielding. If you're a master at dual-wielding, this even lets you skip potential bad effects that wielding the weapon would give you.
* milden curse: Use this technique to turn a sticky/heavily/prime cursed item into a regularly cursed one. If you use it on an item that has the black breath, topi ylinen or ancient morgothian curses, there is only a 10%% chance of turning them into a regularly cursed one.
* force field: Activates a temporary force field that makes monsters with ranged weapons or beam wands much less likely to hit you.
* pointiness: This technique requires you to wield a polearm or lance. If it's a negatively enchanted one, it will become +0, otherwise it can gain an additional point of enchantment, but the chance is lower the more enchantment your weapon has. Maximum that can be reached is +25.
* bug spray: Allows you to place a stinking cloud that deals poison damage to enemies, and also to you should you happen to walk into it.
* whirlstaff: After using this technique, for a certain period of time your quarterstaff can attack several times in a single turn. The higher your quarterstaff skill, the more extra attacks you get.
* deliberate curse: This technique replicates the effect of a potion of unholy water, allowing you to curse an item. Take note that even blessed items go straight to cursed when using this technique, unlike unholy water which would only unbless them.
* acquire steed: Tries to tame an adjacent monster of a 'rideable' class. Of course this is SLEX, you can theoretically ride any monster, but this technique specifically tames the following glyphs: q, u, A, C, D, J, z. Only one monster can be tamed per use, however there's a chance for monsters to resist so if you surround yourself with several potential pets, there's a better chance that not all of them will resist.
* saddling: Creates a saddle out of thin air.
* shopping queen: Every woman's wet dream, this technique lets you shop for shoes! Depending on your high heels skill, there's a certain amount of shoes that you can pick from. You can only pick one pair from the list, which will be placed on the floor. So choose wisely and become the prettiest woman in the dungeon by donning your favorite high heels! (Disclaimer: You don't need to pay money; the technique is basically the voucher that you redeem to get your shoes.)
* beauty charm: This technique requires you to be wearing high heels, and paralyzes you for 10 turns, so be careful when using it. During those turns, it repeatedly tries to pacify humanoids and animals in a 7x7 radius around you, hoping that they fall in love with your beautiful high heels and decide to stop fighting you. However, monsters may resist the attempt and attack you anyway.
* asian kick: If you want to use this technique, you must be wearing stiletto heels. Then it lasts for 50 turns, and once you kick a male humanoid or animal, you will place a devastating kick between their legs. The enemy's nuts will be pushed out of their original position by your very tender stiletto heels, causing unbearable pain to the monster and knocking it out for possibly hundreds of turns, but this technique immediately ends once you successfully kick something with it. Take note that using this technique puts a timeout on all of the following techniques: asian kick, legscratch attack, ground stomp, athletic combat.
* legscratch attack: Requires you to wear cone heels. If you use this technique, your kick attack will be able to scratch up and down the enemy's legs for a while, ripping their shins to shreds, and as a result they'll move more slowly. Do it often enough and their legs will be bleeding so badly that all your kicks deal double damage because your beautiful cone heels are so incredibly sharp-edged! Take note that using this technique puts a timeout on all of the following techniques: asian kick, legscratch attack, ground stomp, athletic combat.
* ground stomp: In order to use this technique, you must be wearing wedge heels. It will last for a while, and if you kick a paralyzed enemy while the technique is active, you'll not only deal double damage but also increase the time for which the enemy is paralyzed, so you can effectively chain-paralyze them. Gotta kick 'em while they're down, and stomp them with your very lovely, massive wedge heels! Take note that using this technique puts a timeout on all of the following techniques: asian kick, legscratch attack, ground stomp, athletic combat.
* athletic combat: Only characters in block heels can use this technique. It lasts for a generous amount of time, and while it's active, you can place a high kick with your block heels at the enemy's belly, shoulder or even their head. The elegance of your very feminine block heels will mesmerize them so much that they may spontaneously stop fighting back, allowing you to kick them again and again with your fleecy block heel. Take note that using this technique puts a timeout on all of the following techniques: asian kick, legscratch attack, ground stomp, athletic combat.
* praying success: This very helpful technique allows you to pray when it would normally not be safe to pray. Please be aware of the fact that your deity is still inaccessible in Gehennom; the gods won't get angry if you use this technique in Gehennom, but they won't be able to help you anyway. Also, there's limits as to what it can do; if your alignment is extremely low or you have a huge prayer timeout, it might still fail, and it won't necessarily work when your god is extremely angry.
* over-ray: After using this technique, your ray and beam wands and spells have a much greater range than usually. It lasts for a generous amount of time. Diagonally fired rays in particular will sometimes bounce for quite a long time!
* enchanterang: A technique that can only be used if you're wielding a boomerang, and which will try to enchant it so you'll be more capable of killing the little poison ivies. You can also wield an entire stack, and as long as it's 10 or less boomerangs in it, the entire stack will be enchanted. Trying to enchant greater stacks can fail, more often the bigger the stack is. Also, boomerangs that are already +25 or higher can not be further enchanted with this technique.
* batman arsenal: If you want to be able to fight Scarecrow, Clayface and the Penguin, you need a lot of batarangs. Using this technique will create one out of thin air!
* jokerbane: Yes, Batman is capable of defeating the Joker, even though he's the biggest villain in all of Gotham City and has three separate ways of instakilling Batman and is also very capable of killing Batman via normal damage. Use this technique and your batarang will be able to paralyze monsters for a while if you throw it!
* call the police: If you need help, use this technique and tame kops will appear to fight your enemies.
* dominate: Tries to tame an adjacent animal. At low technique levels you'll usually only dominate a single one, while with higher levels it may occasionally tame several animals in one use.
* incarnation: Allows you to select an adjacent monster and try to polymorph into it. But beware, there's a one in three chance that you polymorph into something completely random instead.
* combo strike: This technique can be used with chained blitz if you have that, and if you do so, every hit deals 10 extra damage compared to the previous one. Using it 'normally' gives a different effect: for a period of time, every melee hit you land will deal one more point of damage compared to the previous one, but it instantly terminates if you try to use chained blitz while having combo strike active, and it also terminates if you spend a turn doing something other than hitting a monster in melee, so you have to keep attacking things to maximize the effect.
* fungoism: With this technique, you will polymorph into a random F-class monster. Beware, polymorph control doesn't let you choose what you become. Since most fungi aren't capable of wearing armor or wielding weapons, this is a way to shake off cursed ones. However, most fungi also lack limbs and generally make poor fighting forms.
* become undead: Unlike the turn undead technique, this one actually allows you to become an undead creature! This is done by polymorphing you, but the one you turn into is random, even if you have polymorph control.
* jiu-jitsu: A bare-handed combat technique that lasts for a very long time. While it's active, your fists will deal more damage the better a monster's armor class is, but it doesn't increase your to-hit to match, so you'd better be good enough to actually hit the monsters :D
* blade anger: A pain in the butt to code, this technique is supposed to temporarily allow your shuriken to pierce monsters and continue flying after hitting them, but with the downside that when they stop travelling they'll always be broken. The implementation is rather hacky but it kind of works.
* re-taming: Use this technique while standing next to a monster that used to be your pet, and if the monster was peaceful it'll become tame again. Using it on a former pet that actually became hostile only has a 1 in 3 chance of working, and using it on a former pet that became frenzied will never work.
* uncurse saber: Use this technique while wielding a cursed lightsaber and it will be uncursed! If it's heavily cursed or worse, it gets the usual chance of resisting, of course.
* energy conservation: It lasts for a very long time, and reduces the rate at which your lightsaber will use up power. The higher your Makashi skill, the better the reduction.
* enchant robe: This technique requires you to wear a robe, which will receive a random enchantment. If your robe already has an enchantment, it will lose the one it has and get a new random one. And if your Soresu skill is at Grand Master or better, the technique can also occasionally increase the enchantment of your robe up to a maximum of +7; this will never vaporize the robe because SLEX adheres to the 'enhancing your skills should never have detrimental side effects' principle.
* wild slashing: While this technique is active, your dual-wielded lightsabers will attack more quickly but have reduced to-hit.
* absorber shield: A technique that will last for a while, and as long as it's active, blocking a projectile with your lightsaber will add some saber power.
* psycho force: Allows you to select a monster that you can see, which will take damage and be paralyzed for a while.
* intensive training: Every time you use this technique, a random stat will be increased by 1.
* surrender or die: This technique lasts for a few hundred turns and allows your lightsaber attacks to occasionally pacify the opponent, or sometimes your lightsaber will gain enchantment, or the lightsaber gains additional power. But it only triggers if you manage to smash apart an enemy's held weapon.
* perilous whirl: If you use a lit double lightsaber while having this technique active, your attacks may occasionally drain the enemy's levels.
* summon shoe: Well, guess :D It summons a tame shoe that will kick monsters!
* kick in the nuts: Requires you to wear sexy flats, and can only be used on a male monster, which will deal a lot of damage to it and also prevent the target from fighting back for a while.
* disarming kick: This technique can only be used if you wear sexy flats, and will disarm an adjacent monster. If successful, its weapon will land at your feet. Unlike the disarm technique, this works even if the target is holding a cursed weapon.
* inlay warfare: Using this technique requires sexy flats to be worn, and if you do use it, you'll create a stinking cloud at your position and may confuse and paralyze nearby monsters. You will also be confused for a while and need to wait for 2 turns before you can act again, meaning you'll probably be affected by the cloud too.

* telekinesis: A technique that can be used to interact with dungeon features from far away.
