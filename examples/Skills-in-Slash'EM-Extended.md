[[SLASH'EM Extended]] adds a whole bunch of new skills to the game. This page attempts to explain what they do. For players who are new at the game, it's recommended to enhance everything as soon as possible; the player gets so many skill slots that running out won't be a problem for a long while, and inexperienced players in particular will be slightly more likely to survive if they do enhance their skills compared to if they don't.

* '''High heels''' improves the player's AC, charisma and kick damage when wearing high heels, and adds speed boosts at Master. If the player is restricted in this skill, wearing any high-heeled footwear will have a negative effect depending on the type of heel!
* '''General combat''' improves to-hit and to-damage with all melee weapons and also reduces the risk of the weapon dulling on hit.
* '''Shield''' improves AC bonuses and chance to block when a shield is equipped, and reduces the spellcasting chance penalty when wearing a shield. At Expert or higher, the player's hands will not become unuseable if both the weapon and shield are cursed.
* '''Body armor''' improves AC bonuses depending on how many armor pieces are worn, and reduces the spellcasting chance penalty when wearing metallic armor pieces. This skill also reduces the risk of armor pieces dulling when they deflect an attack.
* '''Two-handed weapons''' improves the damage of two-handed weapons (battle-axe, quarterstaff etc.). At Expert or higher, the player's hands will not become unuseable if a cursed two-handed weapon is equipped.
* '''Polymorphing''' is strictly for self-polymorphing only. It affects duration of the player's polymorph, reduces the risk of breaking armor when polymorphing into something large, increases damage of the polymorphed form's attacks, makes it more likely for the player to take "difficult" forms with polymorph control, and more. Trained only by actually polymorphing into a monster. This skill has '''no effect''' on player's attempts to polymorph items or monsters.
* '''Devices''' reduces the odds that a chargeable item (wands, spellbooks, certain tools) loses a charge when used. This skill does nothing on very powerful items like the wand of wishing, but it will come in handy for e.g. wands of death because the player will get more uses out of them on average.
* '''Searching''' increases the chance that the player finds something when using the 's'earch command. This skill is especially useful if the player also has the autosearching in/extrinsic, because it also increases the chance that autosearching finds something.
* '''Spirituality''' makes the prayer timeout faster, i.e. with higher skill the player may pray more often. It also governs saving throw granted from magic cancellation: at Unskilled, MC3 only offers 75% protection from e.g. disenchantment attacks, with every skill point adding 3% chance. Refer to [[https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/User:Bluescreenofdeath/Skills#Magic_cancellation]] for more details.
* '''Petkeeping''' increases the damage output of pets and their healing rate, makes them more resistant to untaming effects, and allows them to follow the player to other levels even when not directly adjacent, with the radius depending on skill level. If the pet isn't directly adjacent, there is a y/n question whether the player really wants to take the pet along, to ensure that higher skill levels don't arbitrarily make it harder to leave unwanted pets behind.
* '''Missile weapons''' increases to-hit and multishot bonuses with all projectile weapons, and for those where the projectiles have a chance of breaking (mulching), higher skill reduces the mulching rate.
* '''Techniques''' speeds up the timeout of all techniques, allowing them to be used more often.
* '''Implants''' is a complicated skill that makes it easier for the player to handle the SLEX-specific "implants" item class. This skill is mainly for handicapped races who get big boosts from implants. Higher skill adds AC bonuses when an implant is worn but more importantly allows the player to take off implants (which is just flat out impossible when unskilled or restricted), and makes it gradually more likely for implants to self-identify when equipped.
* '''Sexy flats''' improves the player's AC and makes stun and dimness time out more quickly when wearing shoes that count as sexy flats.
* '''Memorization''' allows the player to gain additional spell memory when reading a spellbook, and also makes spell memory decrease at a slower rate. This is normally always beneficial, so the player will normally always want to answer 'y' on the prompt whether they want to use memorization to gain additional spell stock; the only exception is if the player specifically wants to forget a spell as quickly as possible (maybe because they want to have a forgotten spell for the confusion on demand). By hitting + to open the spell menu, the player can use the ? key repeatedly to go to "memorization mode": by default, all spells will benefit from the memorization skill. Memorization mode allows the player to dememorize a spell, which will cause a - to appear next to the spell level; the spell in question will not benefit from the skill and be forgotten more quickly. Selecting a dememorized spell again will put it back to memorization mode. '''There is no limit to the amount of spells that can be memorized''', so the general rule of thumb is that the player should have all spells memorized, always, except maybe one spell dedicated to be the one that will become a forgotten spell. The memorization skill level determines how much extra spell memory is given when learning a new spell, and the factor by which spell memory decay is decreased.
* '''Two-weapon combat''' is the dual-wielding skill, which was renamed to (hopefully) remove confusion with the new "two-handed weapons" skill. At Expert, the player's off-hand weapon will not drop if it gets cursed, but can still be dropped manually if the player wants to do so.
* '''Gun control''' improves to-hit with guns and at high skill levels also improves multishot with guns, plus adds damage to slow-shooting guns like rifles.
* '''Squeaking''' reduces the average timeout or mana cost for many #monster abilities and also laying eggs or invoking artifacts.

* '''Orb''' governs damage of orb-class weapons and improves the chance that the player's orb sucks HP or mana from the target to transfer to the player. Orbs also receive damage boosts from the player's quarterstaff skill.
* '''Claw''' governs damage of claw-class weapons. Claws also receive damage boosts from the player's martial arts skill.
* '''Grinder''' governs damage of grinder-class weapons, including the area effect damage they can deal. Grinders also receive damage bonuses from the player's axe skill, which improves both the damage of the initial hit and the area effect damage potential.

* '''Occult spells''' is a spell school skill; all spells from this school have a chance of backfiring when cast. Higher skill makes such backfire incidents less likely.
* '''Elemental spells''' is a spell school skill; spells from this school generally take a lot of reading time to learn.
* '''Chaos spells''' is a spell school skill; spells from this school are harder to cast than the ones from other schools, especially high-level ones, so the player may need a lot of skill to be able to cast them.

* '''Shii-Cho''' increases damage with lit lightsabers.
* '''Makashi''' increases damage with lit one-handed lightsabers if the player's other hand is empty.
* '''Soresu''' increases AC bonuses if a robe is worn while a lit lightsaber is equipped.
* '''Ataru''' increases damage when dual-wielding two lit lightsabers.
* '''Shien''' increases the chance of blocking with a lit lightsaber.
* '''Djem So''' increases the damage of thrown lit lightsabers, done by using 't'hrow and selecting the equipped lightsaber (because putting it into the quiver will unlit it, making the skill do nothing) and also improves the chance that the saber comes back to the player's hand after hitting.
* '''Niman''' increases the player's chance to successfully cast a spell while a lit lightsaber is equipped.
* '''Juyo''' increases the chance that a lit lightsaber will cut through an enemy's weapon.
* '''Vaapad''' increases damage with double lightsabers that have both blades lit.
* '''Wedi''' increases the damage a player's lightsaber does with the #force command, and also improves digging speed when using #force at a wall with the lit lightsaber.

=== Techniques unlocked by skills ===

Certain skills, or in some cases certain combinations of skills, can unlock techniques if the skill level is high enough. These techniques are learned permanently, i.e. they remain known even if the player later loses knowledge in the involved skills. This means that if the player runs out of skill points but wants to unlock more skill-related techniques, one way would be to drain skills or experience levels on purpose to be able to redistribute them. The following skills will unlock techniques (note that the skill levels given are minimum requirements; if the player's skill level is higher than the requirement, e.g. because the character started with a high skill level, the technique will still be learned; if several skills are mentioned, all of those have to be high enough at the same time to actually unlock the technique):
